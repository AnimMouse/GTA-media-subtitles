GTA V - Up-n-Atom Commercial
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/binkaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
In 1950, the first Up-n-Atom restaurant opened.
Life was simpler then.&nbsp;

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.810
The 50's were a sacred time for our nation.
Good clean food,&nbsp;

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.860
happy homogenous people
and well segregated communities.&nbsp;

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.940
An enemy we understood and could control
with the threat of nuclear apocalypse.&nbsp;

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.170
Such was the excitement of the atomic age.
That can do American spirit is in our DNA at&nbsp;

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.690
Up-n-Atom!
We invented the triple burger,&nbsp;

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.160
the 10-Slices-of-Bacon-Triple-Cheese-Melt,
and extra creamy jumbo shake,&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.980
and of course the legendry...
2 way speaker box&nbsp;

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.190
for people that are too lazy to&nbsp;
get out of their cars to eat.&nbsp;

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.420
We don't succumb to trendy health fads.
At Up-n-Atom we've kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.990
many of the same menu items.
We still serve up all of your weekly&nbsp;

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.060
saturated fat,
salt,&nbsp;

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.880
and sugar needs
in one convenient setting.&nbsp;

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.300
Up-n-Atom
Food from when we were morally superior.
