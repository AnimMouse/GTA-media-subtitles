00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.840
In times like these it's important&nbsp;
to remember the good things.&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.920
Sure, the economy may be a little rough,
And we may be shuttering schools,&nbsp;

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.800
hospitals and libraries to pay union pensions.&nbsp;

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.320
But San Andreas is still the&nbsp;
place where dreams are made.&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.760
This is where counter culture began
and then morphed in to a nanny state.&nbsp;

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.320
A place that preaches environmental stewardship
but has terrible public transit system&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.160
and the worst air in the world.
Experience more of San Andreas,&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
the suburban sprawl,
no sense of community,&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.040
and no building more than thirty years old.
Where fluffy children's theme park animals&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.520
are both our heritage and our culture.
San Andreas leads the country in removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.960
pristine first grown forest
to build generic strip malls&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440
and tracked mansions.
San Andreas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.680
we won't be broken hypocrites forever.
