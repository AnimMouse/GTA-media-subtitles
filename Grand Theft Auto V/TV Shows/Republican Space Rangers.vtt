GTA V - Republican Space Rangers
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/rangeau.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.169
Republican Space Rangers!

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.470
Intergalactic war on terror.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.270
We don't worry about collateral damage...

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.270
Or error!

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.090
'Cause we nuke and hate,
we're spreading freedom and liberty.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.040
Sometimes we kill with undue glee!

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.760
Oh, is that your home?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Sorry!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.980
We've gotta complete the mission.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.500
Impossibly deny extraordinary expeditions.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.550
Real American values,
sometimes you've got to bomb

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.070
an orphanage or two.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.960
Republican Space Rangers.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.170
With the world turning more socialist by the
day,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.350
who do you call?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.609
Republican Space Rangers,
They are...

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.579
Butch,
The Commander,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.579
and Dick.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.620
In our last episode
the Rangers bravely attempted to save America

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920
by assassinating the president.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.190
Elated that his approval rating shot up to
ninty-eight per-cent

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.160
President Zane pardoned the rangers
and invited them for a low calorie beer

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.460
and a workout at the white house.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.830
I'm sorry we tried to kill you Mr President.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.500
We didn't like ya,
'cause you're an alien,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.920
and 'cause you's a liberal.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.920
Well...

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.300
That's alright boys, that's alright.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.151
I'm kind of shit-faced!

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.759
Hey, let me show you something funny.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.950
If I tuck it between my legs,
I look like a little girl, only hairy.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.950
Hoorah!

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.460
Well, I can guaran-Goddamn-tee you that,
that's gonna be the last time we ever get

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.189
invited back to the White House.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.469
I'm sorry Commander.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.189
Hey, they can always rebuild that stupid monument,
right?

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.189
Perhaps.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.390
But they won't be able to get the wee-wee
stains

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.750
out of the First Lady's cocktail dress.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420
You do love a black out, Dick.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Always have.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.710
Gentlemen, if you can stay focused
I have a dangerous mission for you.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.840
I need you to pack this ammunition
and hand it out at the mall.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
Woo-wee!

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.909
We're giving civilians live rounds.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.909
Ex-a-fucking-lent!

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.100
Oh, no, no, no.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.280
Our new ammunition is knowledge.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Say what?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.700
These are military leaflets about
how knowledge is understanding.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.670
The policy of "don't ask, you don't want to
know"

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.950
has been lifted.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.010
Your job is to head to the mall to recruit.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.940
The US military now allows
anyone and everyone to be a Space Ranger.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.210
What the fuck?

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.210
Anyone?

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.770
You've got to be shitting me, egghead?

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.770
Listen up!

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.910
I will not, repeat,
will not serve with women,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.910
or open homosexuals!

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.870
Oh, I love the mall!

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.530
If you peek over the top of the changing room,
woo-wee, it's like a live show.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.050
I ain't handing out no fruity-cake leaflets.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.940
I need real military, hoedown shit.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.820
I mean, entire planets on fire,
screaming children,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.890
you know, that sort of thing.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.990
Also, here are you new squadmates
under our rewritten tolerance policy.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.990
Private Luke.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.990
Sir.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.990
And First Sergeant Vanessa.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.990
Commander!

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.990
A...

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.990
G-G-G-Girl?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.370
Girls fight like kitty cats.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.010
And a-a-a gay dude.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.940
How am I supposed to focus on
killing the enemy's family

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.370
and burning his house down,
if I'm worried about some guy

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.710
looking at my hoo-ha!?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.930
Now is a hoo-ha on the front or the back?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.930
Depends, I'll show ya.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.540
It's in the back now.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540
It's in the back.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.560
I can assure you that's not an issue.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.820
I've been in numerous theaters of war,
and won top honors

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.069
and only have one piercing.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.830
The theater!

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.020
You queers are all the same!

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.820
Singing and dancing,
and carrying on with your

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.870
musicals and what not.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.870
Soldiers!

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.870
Enough!

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.870
Get to your bunks!

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.870
Reveille at oh-six-hundred hours.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.870
Mall at oh-nine-hundred.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.580
Shit, we're pinned down.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.560
Throw a grenade and I'll flank 'em.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560
Dick...

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560
Yeah?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
I want you.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
What?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.910
I fantasize about being physically and
emotionally intimate with you.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.720
And rubbing things all over your...

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.720
Woah, woah, woah...

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720
Stop right there.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.700
Goddamn it, I knew this would happen
if they let fruits in the fucking Space Rangers.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.700
Listen!

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.150
Your kind has no business in the military.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.300
How does this feel?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.600
Oh, well it's a...

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600
It's a...

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.760
That's a fucking...

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.170
Serious distraction right there.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.370
Up my bottom...

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.370
Take me.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.430
Give it to me.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.980
Oh yes!

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.980
Yes!

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.320
Oh yes!

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.530
Dick you dumb shit, wake up.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.530
Wake up!

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.380
Who, what, why, where, how, me?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.850
What the hell were you dreaming about there
soldier?

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.850
Uhh...

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.850
Race cars.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.850
Uhh...

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.850
Titties.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.850
Uhh, uhh, b-b-bacon!

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.850
Bacon titties!

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.800
Uhh, an idealized vision of the past.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.590
I sure as hell hope so son,
especially the latter.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.440
Now, you get your ass moving.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.490
We've got to report to the recruitment kiosk
at the mall.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:02.440
Say, ain't this beautiful?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.080
It is beautiful, son.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.410
About the most Goddamn beautiful thing I've
ever seen.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.400
You see it's what we spend all these months
and years fighting for.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
Freedom.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.900
I'm speaking of a freedom to buy
lots of plastic-rack-crap

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.630
made in foreign countries
by adorable slant eyed kids in sweatshops.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.190
Crap that breaks and is instantly out of date,
and the very act of buying it makes us feel

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.000
inadequate,
because we can't afford the more expensive,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.800
or up to date version
no matter how much fucking debt we take on!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.900
It's the only kind of freedom that matters.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.900
And how!

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.300
Maybe not the only kind.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.340
Come on boys!

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.900
Let's get this lame-ass mission over and done
with.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.860
Hand out these leaflets in an efficient and
responsible manner.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.460
Then get back to the base as soon as possible
and

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.810
try to get deployed on a serious combat mission.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.430
You token fruit malingerer.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.860
Listen up...

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.750
What we'll do, boys, is hand out these here
leaflets

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.090
in an efficient and responsible manner.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.030
Then get our keisters back to base as soon
as possible

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.500
to try to get on another serious combat mission.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.740
Yes sir!

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Hay!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740
You!

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740
You look queer.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.970
You're reading and it ain't even a porno.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.440
Have a leaflet.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.580
Just like I thought...

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.290
A rabble-rousing pinko!

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.620
Soldier, I'm recommending you for a medal.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.620
But that man.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.470
And you, I had about enough of you.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.950
What do you mean?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.950
I...

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.950
Jesus!

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.670
Scramble!
Buster, buster, this is foxtrot, delta, bravo,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.670
leader, repeat.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.889
Foxtrot, delta, bravo, leader.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.889
We got a KIA at the mall, here.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:31.889
Ah shit, insurgents are all over us.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:32.889
We're going for immediate backup.

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:33.889
Send them in, send them in.

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:34.889
Yee-ha!

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:35.889
Get some, get some!

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:49.600
We got Charlie all over our asses on this
hill!

00:06:49.600 --> 00:07:02.770
Free men are dying out here!

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.770
You want some?

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.770
Yeah!

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.770
We're gonna need an airstrike!

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.770
Fifty points, that's fifty points!

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.770
Yeah!

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.770
The apocalypse is coming!

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.770
Will it be aliens, zombies,
or a global financial meltdown?

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.290
Whatever it is, you need to be prepared.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.890
Get your complete apocalypse kit at Ammu-Nation.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.280
Contains food stuffs,
and alcohol for three months.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.240
A massive array of armaments,
cartons of cigarettes to trade with roadside

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.060
wanderers,
the apocalypse kit contains birth control

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.080
so you don't create any more mouths to feed,
pornography,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.220
water purifiers so you can drink your own
urine

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.270
and cyanide pills so you can go out like a
man.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.720
When a million zombies come running over the
hill,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.020
you'll be really pissed you didn't buy enough
bullets.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.169
Don't dial 911!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.910
Dial 3-5-7.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.060
Ammu-Nation,
protecting your rights!

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.010
He was a brave ranger,
and now he's gone.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:58.270
And that's what happens when we get
sent in to tough combat situations

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.910
with inadequate support,
due to congress being run by liberals,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.669
and pseudo-liberals,
and pseudo-people who hate pseudo-fucking-America.

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:10.400
Sure, the boy was a butt-pirate,
well he died like one too.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.410
And anyone who says the Space Rangers
won't let queers get shot in the line of duty

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.770
is simply a bigot,
not living in this here century.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.200
But just so we're clear,
straight boys did an even better job.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.139
But what about reports of innocent people
getting caught in the crossfire?

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.139
Fuck that!

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:31.030
That is category-one bullshit, ma'am!

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.969
What kind of innocent person
comes to a friggin' shopping mall?

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:38.130
Anyway, that's all I've got time for,
I gotta go and take a dump.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.499
God bless this country.

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:40.519
Excuse me, Commander.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.240
Commander, Eleanor Von Sawington.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.539
If I may?

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.170
You boys, you did great out there.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.170
Well we was just...

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.589
We was just doing our duty.

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:51.500
You just might be perfect for the new movement
brewing.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.670
You know, I think I'm about ready for a movement
and I need to do my duty.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.399
Is it like a club?

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.529
I like clubs.

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:02.210
Secret handshakes, rituals, and crackers.
and walking like pachyderms.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.270
Yes, yes.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.509
It's kind of like that.

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:06.339
You know, you have to be careful gentlemen.

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:09.510
Without knowing it you are supporting the
liberal agenda.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.769
That is determined to destroy America
for reasons none of us can ever articulate,

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:19.949
but it has something to do with them being
over-educated and looking down on hardworking

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:21.149
people like us.

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:26.380
So much so they want to patronize them
by giving them opportunity.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.380
And how?

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380
It's a terrible shame, ma'am.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.440
Well, all I am saying is you all need to come
to a meeting.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.529
We will give you some real leaflets to hand
out.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:36.529
Okay.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:39.100
See if I can remember my reading...

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.449
It says here...

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:42.029
Do you hate foreigners?

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:44.990
Do you hate progress?

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.350
Do you hate giving money to people who do
nothing to deserve it?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.009
Then you may be perfect for The Coffee Grinder.

00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:53.209
That is right.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:55.699
And with that, it's back to you, Bruce, in
the bunker.

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:56.699
I mean studio.

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:57.699
Say what?

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:58.930
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.559
You are among friends now.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.529
Thank God for that.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:04.529
Friend!

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:06.540
Public education is socialism.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.850
Well, well, well.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.990
Just look at all these honest,
hardworking folk expressing their

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.230
God-given views.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.740
Hey, and they're handing out free beers
and chicken wings!

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.480
I'll tell you what, this is my kind of rally
right here.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.800
It's even more fun than that one where we
wore

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.130
them silly hoods.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.130
Remember that?

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.130
Yeah.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.130
Hey boys, shout this.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.519
Why, you'll fit in and feel manly.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.519
Well, thank you, sir.

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.519
Who do we hate?

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.519
Ourselves.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.519
What are we doing?

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:34.519
Giving tax breaks to the rich!

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:36.339
What do we hate?

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:37.339
Equality.

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:39.059
What are we doing?

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:41.189
Fucking ourselves in the can!

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:42.579
Woo!

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:43.970
Woo!

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.899
I'll tell you what, this is just great.

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:50.540
Everyone's pulling together for the good of
the nation.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.499
I am turtling something fierce.

00:10:52.499 --> 00:10:53.860
I got a pebble poking out.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.850
I could use a comfort station as well.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.240
That chimmy-chonger's blasting through me
at hyper speed.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:08.070
Man, we're all going to the bathroom together
like girls.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.660
Well, Edmond, this just might work.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.129
Yes, Fitzgerald, yes.

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:19.050
After our last successful campaign,
anything is possible.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:25.529
And I say to you, that what we need
is more Christmases and Thanksgiving.

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:27.209
I wanna get basted.

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:28.629
Now, who's with me?

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:32.829
Now, you and me need to find the perfect patriotic
halfwit

00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:36.149
to ground as our coffee grinder candidate
for President.

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:40.680
Which we'll back with a billion dollars,
and take ownership of Congress and the White

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.029
House,
and deregulate to our heart's content.

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:46.050
You have a heart brother.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.240
You softie.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.750
Oh, my bowels.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.930
Where did those assholes go?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:00.369
Man, I'm gonna drop a bomb out my ass
that would melt the city in to glass.

00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:05.009
The Coffee Grinder party is about turning
public schools in to shoe factories.

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:06.009
And...

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:07.009
Uh, sir...

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:08.009
Excuse me, sir...

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:09.050
What are you doing?

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.100
Sir...

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.249
Oh my God!

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:20.970
Hey, ain't that the fellow that tried to
assassinate the President,

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.550
urinated on the First Lady and
blew up the Washington Monument?

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.720
And now he's literally taking a crap on the
United States Capitol.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.119
I think we may have found our candidate, brother.

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:39.749
Will the creepy billionaire brothers
hatch their evil scheme?

00:12:39.749 --> 00:12:43.089
Will Dick become the next President of the
United States?

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:45.319
Will Butch become the First Lady?

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:48.899
Find out next time, only on...

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:51.459
Republican Space Rangers.
