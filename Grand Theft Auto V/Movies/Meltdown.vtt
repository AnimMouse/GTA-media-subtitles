GTA V - Meltdown Movie
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/meltaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:23.148
Come in Alpha-Bravo-Sierra.
Do you read?&nbsp;

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:27.300
I've almost got him.
That last monkey's DNA will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.970
save us from the Apocalypse.
You have to catch him!&nbsp;

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.115
I've got him!
Remember, don't stick your penis inside it.&nbsp;

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:35.175
Why would I do a thing like that?
What are you doing solider?&nbsp;

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:48.750
This means war!
Coming this summer!&nbsp;

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
Mankind has fucked his cousin...
One last time!&nbsp;

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.460
The Simian.
Rated PA for post apocalyptic nonsense.&nbsp;

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:38.760
The problem with Darwin is
he was a biologist.&nbsp;

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.790
I'm a mathematician.
And we know&nbsp;

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.140
that in the world there are two kinds of people.
People who remember how to count,&nbsp;

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.510
and people who we can&nbsp;
convince a new way of counting&nbsp;

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.020
while fleecing them for every penny they've got
and then charging them for the pleasure.&nbsp;

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.980
Capitalism depends on one&nbsp;
thing, and one thing only...&nbsp;

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.560
A steady supply of idiots.
Idiots just like you!&nbsp;

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.940
You're paying for an education.
What's wrong with reading books on our own?&nbsp;

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.420
Well two things,
first - reading is for pussys.&nbsp;

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.540
Nobody ever learned anything&nbsp;
useful from reading a book.&nbsp;

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.720
Second of all,
you're not here to learn,&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.510
you're here to meet people just like yourself.&nbsp;

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.860
And lay down on that same&nbsp;
conveyor belt as everyone else.&nbsp;

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.110
The conveyor belt that says
"If I do the right things"&nbsp;

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.360
"If I play the game dirty enough"
"If I eat enough babies"&nbsp;

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.290
"Then I, too, can become&nbsp;
stinking rich and soulless."&nbsp;

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.540
Let me be clear,
I am stinking rich...&nbsp;

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.780
and soulless.
Yes! Yeah! Awesome! Amazing! Woo! Yes!&nbsp;

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:25.360
Oh my God.
Mr. Fitch, I loved your lecture.&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.270
That was amazing.
I love how you made stocks seem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.520
like, totally exciting.
Yeah, yeah.&nbsp;

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.330
and how, how buying a share is sorta like
raping and pillaging, only in a cool way.&nbsp;

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.200
Ladies, make this quick.
You're costing me time and time is a cliché.&nbsp;

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.640
You think I'm gonna take you under my wing
and become a father figure to you&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.820
so you can date my daughter,
and then betray me in the end?&nbsp;

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.890
Well, stop wasting my time and
let's get on with narrative gang bang.&nbsp;

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.300
Ok, sounds good.
Let's do it.&nbsp;

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.730
Listen, I've got a sports car,
I'm rich,&nbsp;

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.890
and I'm busy.
But nothing gives me more joy&nbsp;

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.580
than corrupting greedy young innocence...
except...&nbsp;

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.110
I can only take one of you.
So...&nbsp;

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.830
Say goodbye to your friend.
B-B-But we're best friends...&nbsp;

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.300
W-We moved to Liberty City together
to pursue our dreams of-of trading stocks.&nbsp;

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.480
Sorry bud!
It's time to say goodbye to you,&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.530
and to see some glamorous images
set to power pop!&nbsp;

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:50.180
He was holding you and the narrative back.
All this can be yours!&nbsp;

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.900
Wait, you mean the whole city?
Just as long as you forsake your friends&nbsp;

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.497
and your values.
Yeah! Count me in!&nbsp;

00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:54.516
Woof!
What was that?&nbsp;

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:54.527
Foley.
Oh...&nbsp;

00:04:54.527 --> 00:05:05.810
So you're saying that all this...
Is yours?&nbsp;

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.110
All from selling pieces of&nbsp;
other people's businesses.&nbsp;

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.300
I knew at that moment,
it was time to introduce a portentous voiceover.&nbsp;

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.330
Stocks.
Credit default swaps.&nbsp;

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.100
The whole Capitalistic circle jerk.
Jesus man!&nbsp;

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.970
You make maths sound so homoerotic.
It's just like football.&nbsp;

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.720
You build up an analogy,
you pat another man on the buttocks,&nbsp;

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.010
then the whole thing falls apart
and everyone gets brain damage.&nbsp;

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.170
Okay, yeah I think I...
I think I get it.&nbsp;

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.840
Who was she?
A hot, brainless women to act as a plot device?&nbsp;

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.820
Was she my love interest?
That's Miranda.&nbsp;

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.330
She'll never be fully explained,
also she won't talk.&nbsp;

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.870
The Actors' Union lets us pay extras
at half the rate.&nbsp;

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.400
That's how I got this yacht, Dylan,
by screwing the worker!&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.230
That's what made this country the way it is.
Wait, so Adner...&nbsp;

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.270
Seriously like...
What's the deal with this?&nbsp;

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.230
I mean, you take me under your wing and
everything's really exciting but&nbsp;

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.440
it's also at the same time a little bit creepy.
But we haven't even discussed&nbsp;

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.540
synthetic collateralized stock options,
or mortgage-backed securities,&nbsp;

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.850
or even exotic DNA swaps.
You wanna have...&nbsp;

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.980
you wanna have a real conversation?
You wanna go there?&nbsp;

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.910
You're ready to face the big boys
and the bold facts of the world&nbsp;

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.690
and the way it works?
Well let's go stand in the middle of a park&nbsp;

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.660
for literally no reason.
I see something in you Dylan.&nbsp;

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.090
You seem naïve
and in need of a father figure.&nbsp;

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.000
Because yours probably died...
or is gay.&nbsp;

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.520
Umm...
But you're also hungry&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.470
and greedy,
and vindictive.&nbsp;

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.090
Which I like!
Yeah.&nbsp;

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.060
I'm a lion
I eat my young.&nbsp;

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.010
But in your case, I'm gonna make an exception.
You're the son I always wanted,&nbsp;

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.350
and if you think that this is setting&nbsp;
up an event in an act or two later&nbsp;

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.100
when I will present you with a clear moral dilemma
then you are wrong.&nbsp;

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.440
Wait, really?
It's happening now!&nbsp;

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.020
Let's look at some graphs,
and scales,&nbsp;

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.610
and images of skyscrapers.
America really is amazing!&nbsp;

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.840
Did you know we're the world's&nbsp;
leading country at graphics?&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.460
Listen kid!
Nothing makes me feel more alive&nbsp;

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.200
than crushing a man in business,
then destroying a large chunk of the economy.&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.190
You really are a Titan!
I am the "Archduke of Metaphors"&nbsp;

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.882
I am the...
I am...&nbsp;

00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:31.896
No!
No, no, no!&nbsp;

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:31.909
Don't die!
No!&nbsp;

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.940
You're not finished yet!
Please!&nbsp;

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:48.590
You can't die on me!
What? Are you crying?&nbsp;

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.490
Yeah!
I thought you were dead!&nbsp;

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.940
I can't die yet!
My work here isn't finished.&nbsp;

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.260
My masterpiece awaits!
What about the talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.100
monkey that we haven't met yet?
Or-or-or the unexplained dog bark?&nbsp;

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.210
Or-or my best friend that got written out?
Or-or-or the sequel rights?&nbsp;

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.650
What about the useless VO that no one needs?
Screw you!&nbsp;

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.590
Come here I wanna show you something.
What are you doing?&nbsp;

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.500
I've hacked in to every major&nbsp;
stock company on the exchange.&nbsp;

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.690
Wait, just now?
That seems, like, really easy.&nbsp;

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.620
Ah, we can't get bogged down with&nbsp;
the realities of IT and technology.&nbsp;

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.630
Just know this,
with the stroke of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.220
button on this untraceable laptop
every publicly traded company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.080
on the BAWSAQ will be wiped out.
And I've shorted the lot, a complete meltdown.&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.140
Finally he said the title.
Good!&nbsp;

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.960
We can use this scene in the trailer!
I'll scoop up shares through shell corporations.&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.090
And make billions, hundreds of billions.
I won't have this monkey on my back...&nbsp;

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.270
Foreshadowing.
Nobody can fucking stop me!&nbsp;

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.250
I just said fuck...
I'm an outlaw!&nbsp;

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.640
That means we get an R rating.
Wait! Does that mean we have to have sex&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.130
with the same women and then like,
watch each other while we do it?&nbsp;

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.960
Thankfully not.
Just know this...&nbsp;

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.770
Nothing can stop me now!
Except me!&nbsp;

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.070
Yeah right, what you gonna do?
Fling your shit at me?&nbsp;

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.430
Not him! Me!
Chip!&nbsp;

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:19.070
You fools won't ruin my plan!
We'll race through the city at high speed.&nbsp;

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.530
I've just pressed this button.
And now tense music is playing.&nbsp;

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.460
And there's data moving really quickly.
Oh my God.&nbsp;

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.510
If we don't get that laptop,
good, honest capitalism is dead!&nbsp;

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:38.580
We've gotta get that computer!
Dude!&nbsp;

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.490
Why'd you let the monkey drive?
Because it looks cool!&nbsp;

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.390
It also properly says something about society
which may or may not be racist,&nbsp;

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.040
sexist,
and/or stupid.&nbsp;

00:09:52.090 --> 00:10:17.870
Oh shit!
Woo!&nbsp;

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:24.020
You never did get that diploma, did you?
No, but I got something even better Chip.&nbsp;

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.350
I got a life lesson,
and we made a new friend.&nbsp;

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.540
Gosh, I just love this city.
Me too!&nbsp;

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.640
You can have blow delivered right to your door,
and there's this great dim sum joint in Chinatown&nbsp;

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.350
where swingers pee on each other.
No, that's not really what I mean.&nbsp;

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.050
I mean more the energy,
and the innocent good times.&nbsp;

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.600
Man, I can't believe I almost lost everything,&nbsp;

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.050
all because I got greedy,
and saw one too many computer graphics.&nbsp;

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.350
But you know what?
America's about taking long walks,&nbsp;

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.100
with a good friend,
and just loving your country.&nbsp;

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.170
It's about apple pie,
and baseball,&nbsp;

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.560
and hating injustice.
It's about letting people be heard!&nbsp;

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.690
It's about equality,
for everybody!&nbsp;

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:16.100
Hey guys, Miranda, Monkey,&nbsp;
Dylan's weird voiceover.&nbsp;

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.945
I'm the mayor.
Hooray!&nbsp;

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:21.590
And you just saved Capitalism&nbsp;
from greed and excess.&nbsp;

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.230
Now here's a prize,
It's a song and dance routine,&nbsp;

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.050
'cause we all know they don't&nbsp;
write 'em like this anymore.
