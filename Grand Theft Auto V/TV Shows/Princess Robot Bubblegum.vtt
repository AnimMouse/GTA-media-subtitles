GTA V - Princess Robot Bubblegum
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/prinaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:12.380
Princess Robot Bubblegum!

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:22.589
What are you doing master?

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.509
I'm reading the comments on your recent videos.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.930
These people are a little, uh, uh, a little...

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.609
They're a bunch of horny,
lonely,

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.609
perverts.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:32.609
Those are your fans!

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:33.609
Be respectful.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.310
Do not bite the hand that feeds.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.310
Okay.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.310
So what are they saying about me?

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.080
Oh, let me see here.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.870
This one said that your boyfriend is to feminine,
like he plays both sides of the sushi bar,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.610
but he don't like fish,
or surf clam,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.980
he only like octopus.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.320
But this is a terrible analogy.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.550
Where's that useless,
cutsey sidekick of yours?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.550
That walks on the tips of his toes.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.550
What the hell?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.550
Saki make distil go boom!

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.450
Saki, you little alcoholic shit bag.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.490
Are you okay?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.890
Oh, he's fine.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.810
It's just a concussion of massive internal
bleeding, or something.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.810
Poke him.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.480
That wasn't Saki's elicit booze bath.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.820
Something is going on outside.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.890
Argh!!!

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.300
Ah, so definitely now this guy really dead.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.130
He's like a floaty pancake.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.690
Now, we could license that.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.940
Yes, that's what we'll do.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.210
License part of a balanced breakfast.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.760
Princess-Robot-Bubblegum-Crispy-Snachy-Pops,
and special floaty pancakes.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.820
Oh no!

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.850
Oh, the ancient ones warned this day would
come.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.700
What ancient ones, master?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.130
Those geriatric tight-asses at the bank.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.729
They say they gonna foreclose on me.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.380
Knock down the sacred temple and
build a twenty-four hour drive through massage

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.780
parlor
with, you know, like, human traffic Australian

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.479
chicks, love it.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.229
You don't even have to leave your car
she just reach through the window.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.340
Wanky, wanky, wanky!

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.989
"Hi Bloke, you wanna a cock or two?"

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.550
Okay, girl.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:22.030
Hey girl, there is a big wrecking ball outside,
and it's gonna smash your house down.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.630
We know!

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.280
Calm down bitch,
you gonna ruin my hair.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.810
Master, you taught me discipline,
why haven't you paid the bills?

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420
I was, uh...
very distracted.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.630
I have a three-hundred year mortgage to pay
and my pension got cut.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.030
It's hard time for everybody.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.030
Pension?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.750
I thought you was an ancient ninja master,
is what you told me.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.840
I am!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.400
Many years ago,
I was an ancient ninja,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.840
post master.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.489
For... about five years.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.330
And then I retire on a two-hundred-and-seventy-five
year pension.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.530
I can throw a postcard across the room
and give you a terrible paper cut.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.940
The post office was horrible,
Licking, stamping, licking, licking,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.940
Goddamn it!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.690
It's like dealing with my second wife.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.930
Your face goes numb,
you take a coffee break,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.930
you turn your back to a soul crushing job
that leaves you feeling terrible afterwards.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.940
Hello...
master...

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.989
How are we going to save our house?

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.290
Fucked if I know.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.290
Wait! Merchandising!

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.319
But master, since the last DVD got edited
by censors in the west,

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.720
we don't sell so many.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.140
So, no more merchandising.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.590
No more Princess Robot Bubblegum dolls,
or pencil cases,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.500
or rulers,
or blow up companions,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.720
or love balls,
or erotic massage oils,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.230
or all the other creepy shit you've sunk all
our money into.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.390
Sometimes the path is not straight,
but is still true.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.310
Oh, I like that line, I like that.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.239
maybe I sell it on a bumper sticker.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.209
Anyway, the path of truth,
is still the path of merchandising.

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.260
Personal merchandising.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.090
Merch, merch, merch!

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.849
I never knew you worked in marketing.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.940
Oh, it's easy.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.730
Any one fool with half an MBA can do it.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.870
Listen, you will save our house in the time
honored way.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.620
You will please horny men,
one after the other,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.659
they will be standing in line
for a chance at you.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.220
And we can charge them twenty dollars a pop.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.700
Master, I won't be a massage girl.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.750
No stupid bitch!

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.930
We go to comic convention.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.650
You sign autograph and we sell some more action
figures.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.909
We rebrand erotic oil as uh...
as uh...

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.150
Personal usage erotic oil for the lonely lover.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.860
And branded socks to clean yourself up afterwards.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.220
You know, it's prostitution of a different
kind...

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.490
But legal!

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.800
Personal merchandising.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.620
It makes my loins ache.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.630
Oh, this is so exciting.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.300
Never in my years of being a blind,
androgynous child,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.380
with a huge sword,
could I have imagined such wonders.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.380
Yes!

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.560
Truly the script writers have reached new
heights.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.680
Time for an incongruous clip of an arousing
girl fight.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.620
You see...

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.020
You like that.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.889
You do, don't you?

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.760
My poor little Saki.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.901
He was always drunk and slept in my underwear
drawer,

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.380
but I loved him like a brother.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.380
Please.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.830
That's like the last 5 guys you've gone out
with.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.820
Master, what are you doing?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.820
There!

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.960
Fuck that little blue raccoon.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.580
We'll get you a new one.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.580
Master!

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.620
Oh, please, oh, please.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.240
Turn off the water works.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.040
Shut up!

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.810
Cry me a river, you're a big girl.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.770
This is exciting rebranding opportunity.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.479
Nothing sell like a cute animal sidekick.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.200
We have auditions,
we'll change them every season.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.750
Flavor of the month...

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.030
Fuck it!

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.170
Humpy!

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.310
Muffy!

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.450
Grindy!

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.590
Smoker!

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.730
Poopie!

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.640
What the fuck?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.680
Where are we, Germany?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.960
Okay, you'll do.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.480
Humpy, humpy!

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.000
Audition over!

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.450
Blind boy, kill the rest.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.450
Come on!

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.450
We've got to get to the convention center,
and save this ancient temple.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.710
Did somebody shit on the floor?

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.050
Princess Robot Bubblegum is brought to you
by...

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.110
Nogo Vodka
The new premium vodka

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.169
that comes from a place where everyone's depressed,
most people are unemployed

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.550
and a few rich people have stolen all the
money.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.550
Not Russia!

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.940
The Midwest.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.250
Nogo, premium vodka from the heartland.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.710
Not the motherland.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.160
Oh, this place smells something terrible.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.949
It's like a fat person's armpit.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.620
Kutty, for real.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.840
And nobody's buying nothing.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.460
That is my special vapor machine.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.610
It attracts nerds with the smell of
unwashed loneliness.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.970
It is very powerful.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.340
That's why I bring this.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.820
When the battle rages hardest,
every warrior know you have to fend for yourselves.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.250
Put that shit on a sticker!

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.069
I thought your last film was really lacking.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.840
Anime has moved beyond your hackneyed stereotypes.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.889
Clothes made from belts,
an emo character,

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.840
tentacle rape.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.520
It's just such a cliché.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.330
It's not like in Rapefest Quark Zoom,
where they subvert the clichés

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.810
by embracing them.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.900
And then undermining them by making them all
true.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.229
But then that's written by a genius.

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:47.599
Whereas your show is such a hack job.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.120
Seriously, where do they find these people?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.780
Are you going to fucking buy something?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.910
Oh, have you met Humpy?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.750
He's the hot new sidekick.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.290
Humpy, plumb punch.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.210
You're old news,
The future of anime is

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.710
Shiny Wasabi Kitty.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.710
She's awesome.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.710
Wait!

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.710
Who's that?

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.110
That is Shiny Wasabi Kitty.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.479
Hello nerd.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.310
I train her many years ago.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.389
She was my pupil,
but she turned evil.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.050
Girl, I'm blind and knew that bitch was evil.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.140
I could smell it.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.770
She had sulfur spewing down south.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.090
And she is overtly sexy,
but also tough and good at fighting,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.759
just like every nerd really wants.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.930
But how is she evil?

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.729
She won a large cut of residuals.

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:35.149
I tell her, she just like my last boy band...

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.329
"In Ass"
I like boy bands.

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:39.789
She seems to be doing just fine without you.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.149
Alright girl, this is what we need to do...

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:42.550
We need to sabotage that bitch.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.550
We won't give her the competition, okay?

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.449
Come on, Humpy, you with me, girl?

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:47.449
Humpy, sabotage!

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:50.050
Listen up, listen, listen, listen, you listening
okay?

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.920
Let's do something really impressive,
that we haven't figured out yet

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.329
and get people liking our show again.

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:55.480
So what we gonna do?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.089
By the way, how'd I look?

00:08:58.089 --> 00:08:59.089
Humpy, humpy.

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.129
Oh, Wasabi Kitty is humping!

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:02.439
It's so postmodern!

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:03.839
I wanna buy a T-shirt!

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.819
What a cute, horny sidekick.

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:08.069
How about you come on my show?

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.019
I'll give you five percent.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:11.869
Humpy like percentages.

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:13.720
Winky, winky time!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720
Urgh...

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720
Stop that.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.050
That's demeaning to women.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.189
No it's not!

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:20.189
This is great!

00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:21.189
It's art!

00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:24.129
Who are you to determine what's demeaning
to women?

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:28.059
It's not demeaning,
you subvert the clichés.

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:32.949
I am the clichés.

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:36.619
Look at me.

00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:39.069
Bitch fight!

00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:40.300
Yes!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.410
Reverse cowgirl, spaghetti bomb, sparkle!

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:52.529
Smiley, cheesecake, potty tongue, shocker.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:10:03.269
This is really, really,
subverting those clichés.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:12.779
Too horny to fight clichés.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.680
Stop!

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.579
Why?

00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:22.459
You've stolen my fans,
and my sidekick.

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:25.949
And I'm going to lose my house.

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:26.949
Yeah!

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:29.120
You defected from me,
you fucking whore bag.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.720
Stop crying, and start fighting!

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.800
Take your clothes off!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.360
Stop indulging them.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.970
Watch this, it's just as much fun.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.970
Wait! Woo!

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.970
You try.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.970
Wow!

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.970
That felt...

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.970
Liberating, right?

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.970
What's happening?

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:56.999
I love you, Princess Robot Bubblegum.

00:10:56.999 --> 00:11:05.489
Wow, that was awesome!
but we'll still lose the house,

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:06.489
and now I have no fans left.

00:11:06.489 --> 00:11:07.489
I'm sorry master.

00:11:07.489 --> 00:11:08.489
Are you kidding me?

00:11:08.489 --> 00:11:10.660
I got the whole thing on my smartphone.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.939
Put behind pay wall,
make episodic.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:14.350
Oh merchandising, merchandising.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.350
Merchandising!

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.190
And subverting all the clichés.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:23.440
And now...
if I could get you two,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.790
to maybe, you know...
kiss,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:33.249
or delicately fondle each other,
or even not so delicate.

00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:41.129
Humpy, humpy, freezeframe time!

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:45.069
Oh no!

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:48.550
Why are you on the ceiling?

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.670
Is it the anti-gravity gun again?

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.670
Shit nozzles.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.079
No, we've been shot with the anti-narrative
gun.

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:57.230
This episode makes no sense.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.230
Oh yeah!

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.230
We ran out of ideas how to end this episode.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:06.559
So I'm just gonna sing a song to you.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.009
How come you...

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:10.009
mmm...

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:12.149
You smell so Asian,
but you look so Caucasian?

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.089
I can't get next to your love girl.

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:20.600
I'm gonna break you in half,
little Japanese woman.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.929
I like them big eyes,
like sausage in a small mouth,

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.829
like a mouse's ear.

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:27.319
Get rid of that sissy man you with...

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:28.549
Oh yeah.

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:30.959
Shut up fucking singing, plant-ass bitch.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:31.240
How I look?
