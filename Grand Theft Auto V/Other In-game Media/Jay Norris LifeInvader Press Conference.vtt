GTA V - Jay Norris LifeInvader Press Conference
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/ls1aaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.590
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.590
Please welcome Mr. Jay Norris to the stage!

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.600
Hey.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.640
This company has come a long way
since we started it in my parents' pool house

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.470
in East Carraway.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.570
Today, you're about to witness a new phase.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.070
Full on, weapons grade, red alert, world domination!

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.199
Wooo!

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.330
Wooo!

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.460
Wooo!

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.220
We have put a billion people's private data
in the public domain,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.410
and we have milked every penny we could in
the process.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.500
Wooo!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.590
Wooo!

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.690
We have one of the youngest work forces in
the world!

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.950
An average age of only fourteen point four
years.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.280
That's not just impressive.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.460
It's revolutionary!

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.600
Wooo!

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.739
Yay!

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:55.879
Wooo!

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.020
Yay!

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.160
Today.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.440
Right here.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.580
We are about to make the next step!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.659
Prepare to witness...

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.939
The future.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.079
Dock!

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.219
Dock!

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.359
Dock!

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.499
Dock!

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:16.639
Dock!

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:17.789
Dock!

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.450
The Lifeinvader mobile device.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.729
Yes, we've invented something no one else
has ever thought of.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.729
A small personal computerized device.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.820
Now, you're going to be able to stay docked
twenty-four seven.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.240
On the bus.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.979
You can dock.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.479
On the subway.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
Stay docked.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.849
You can be docked in at home,
and at the same time

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.049
you're docking with some kids at the public
pool.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.049
Dock!

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.049
Dock!

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.049
Dock!

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.049
Dock!

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.049
Dock!

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.049
Dock!

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.049
Dock!

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.049
Dock!

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.719
We went to the guys at Fruit Computers
and we told them we wanted to make our hardware

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.459
as compatible as possible.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.179
But you know what?

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.039
They're not interested in "sharing" their
technology.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.039
Boo!

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.039
Boo!

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.820
So we went and made it compatible anyway.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.969
Now, you can dock your Lifeinvader to an iFruit
phone or any other device,

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.489
and it'll take all the data off it
and reformat it into Lifeinvader-friendly

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.739
information.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.000
Woooo!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.519
Woo, woo!

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.720
At around this point in my presentation there
was meant to be a call

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.799
from my product team to introduce the device,
but we're experiencing some technical difficulties.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.969
I hate to keep you waiting any longer,
but trust me,

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:46.969
it's worth it.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.400
And don't worry,
I will fire several people for this.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
Boo!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
Boo!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.401
Boo!
