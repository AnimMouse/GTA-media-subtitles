Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/fos2aud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.530
The talent show Darwin would have loved.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.680
Fame or Shame.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.540
One of you is going to be a superstar.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.920
The rest of you losers are gonna be on suicide
watch!

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.370
The finals continue with...

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.470
Three Masturbating Monkeys.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.750
Those monkeys just love masturbating.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620
They're going to the finals
IntamaC

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.620
IntamaC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.620
You're terrifying...

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.620
Terrifyingly talented!

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.620
What, What!

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.620
Inzest!

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.330
You guys have won!

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.950
I don't even have words for these guys!

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.950
William Angio.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.399
Fuck yeah, buddy.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.399
Fuck yeah!

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.829
Get over here, come on.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.829
Ok.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.890
Americans are obsessed with money,
and celebrity,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.879
and will do anything to get it.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.620
What will they do tonight?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.889
Recorded live at the Vinewood Bowl,
It's Fame or Shame the Finals.

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.639
And now, please welcome your host,
ambiguous star of radio and TV...

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:58.639
Lazlow!

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:59.639
Woo!

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:00.639
Yeah!

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.489
Thank you, thank you!

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.990
You're too much!

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.289
Thank you so much.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.280
We have a fantastic show for you tonight.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.710
Another night of disposable television on
Weazel,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.850
reality shows and talent contests.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.030
One after the other.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570
Because America's forgotten how to laugh.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.600
No they haven't.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.979
Look at your hair...

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.770
It looks like you've combed it with a dog's
arse.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.640
Good one!

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.619
Well...
you know,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.409
it often gets messed up when I'm banging your
mom!

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.130
Hugh Harrison, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.130
Hi... umm...

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.280
She's just passed on actually...

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
My, mum.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520
Oh my gosh, that's so sad.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Umm...

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.060
Well she did seem kind of pale and quiet but...

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.200
Well you know,
I like Goth chicks.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.979
You can do whatever you want to 'em and...
and they don't call the cops.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.979
Umm...

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.909
Let's get on with it,
the Fame or Shame panel,

00:01:58.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Anita Mendoza.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.960
So good to see you guys again.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.190
I love judging people
that are desperate for attention.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.190
Ay-oh!

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.190
Ay-oh!

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.050
And our spiritual advisor and judge
Imran Shinowa.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.070
Spiritual proverb says,
"All things that are white are not milk".

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.430
Especially the stuff on Lazlow's neck.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.370
What are you talking about?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.520
That's gotta be icing or something.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.990
Listen, enough of this.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.720
We have got some fantastic acts to get to,
and some even more fantastically

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.030
subtle product placement.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.080
Alright, we're back on Fame or Shame.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500
I've got some bad news and good news.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340
The bad news is we had a few problems
with our voting machines.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.500
But the good news is we fixed it!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.690
And do I have a surprise for you...

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.920
Making it to the finals...
a personal favorite of mine...

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.470
Tracey De Santa.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.030
So, hello America.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.670
God I'm so nervous I wanna pee.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.670
Shit...

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.650
I mean pee, not shit.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.020
Anyway,
here's a song I wrote about...

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.832
Someone, about whether us girls end up as
scholars,

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:14.832
or strippers.

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:15.832
Hey daddy what happened to you and me?

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:16.832
I've heard sorry before.

00:03:16.832 --> 00:03:17.832
Get-up, get-out.

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:18.832
The lives you break and don't hesitate,
Don't wanna become a hoe, oh, oh.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.832
Out of control this crazy ride.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:20.832
Can't take it anymore oh, oh.

00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:21.832
Hey!

00:03:21.832 --> 00:03:22.832
Hey!

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:23.832
Hey!

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:24.832
I might need my therapy.

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:25.832
Hey!

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:26.832
Hey!

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:27.832
Hey!

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:28.832
Tell me what happened to you?

00:03:28.832 --> 00:04:14.220
I know you're cheating night and day.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:43.080
Your little girl deserves the best.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
You know that I love you so, oh, oh.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080
Your head's in the clouds
and I could never get your damn attention.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
What happened to you and me?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080
I've heard sorry before.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080
Get-up, get-out.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080
The lives you break and don't hesitate,
Don't wanna become a hoe, oh, oh.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080
Hey daddy what happened to you and me?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.080
I've heard sorry before,
Get-up, get-out.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
The lives you break and don't hesitate,
Don't wanna become a hoe, oh, oh.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080
Out of control this crazy ride.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080
Can't take it anymore, oh, oh.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
Yeah, that was fantastic.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080
I mean amazing,
especially the "Hoe, oh, oh" part.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
And really from the heart.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
Judges, I have to say,
I'm thinking if you go the wrong way on this

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080
it could be the end of a lot of promising
careers.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.080
Alright we're gonna go to commercials and
we'll come back with the judges' decision.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
Seriously guys.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.080
Vote the right way 'cause a maniac's gonna
fucking kill me.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.940
The all new plug-in Karin Dilettante.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.860
Official hybrid of Fame or Shame.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.080
With a range of ten miles.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.760
Bad plus good equals better for everyone.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.030
Alright we're back on Fame or Shame.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.930
This is the moment America has been waiting
for.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.490
Yes, who is gonna win that one million dollars
and go on a tour of the lower Mid-West?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.240
Who is going to lose and be sobbing in the
corner,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240
cutting themselves?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Hopefully you.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.530
Excuse me, sorry.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.280
I have something to say.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.500
Cutting and Bulimia is serious!

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500
Yeah... seriously sexy!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.670
Alright, over the last few days we've seen
a lot of acts go to the finals.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.420
Here's a quick recap.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.400
You loved She Male Bop.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.250
They're alright.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.010
Everybody said a lot of stuff at the water
cooler about,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.010
Mimes on Fire.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.710
A little pitchy.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.590
How about the Most Racist Man in America?

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.610
You all disgust me!

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.120
Loved it.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
Loved.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.820
And the power ballad of William Angio.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.010
Because this is a power ballad...

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.400
Nice guy.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.540
And of course the one we all know that's gonna
win,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.900
Tracey De Santa.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900
Hey!

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900
Hey!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.900
Hey!

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.419
I might need my therapy.

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.419
Hey!

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.419
Hey!

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.419
Hey!

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.419
Who was that?

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:41.510
I don't remember.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.900
She was good, she was good.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.340
Alright, America's on the edge of their recliners.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.950
I can feel the excitement.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.030
Who is gonna win that
one million dollars on Fame or Shame?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.970
Let's go to Anita Mendoza.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.810
Oh, ok.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.710
Everyone is so talented,
Yeah, especially Tracey.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.130
But I'm going to have to go with...

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.130
Okay.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.130
Umm, so sorry.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.130
Umm, let me just, okay...

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.130
Umm...

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.620
I'm gonna go with
Masturbating Monkeys.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.820
What?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.330
Masturbating Monkeys.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.699
No.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:19.640
I heard you.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.000
Hugh, alright, you're a great judge of talent.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Thank you.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.970
Who's gonna win that one million dollars?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.650
Who's got the most talent?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.580
It was a very tough competition.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:38.760
But for me,
I'd have to say,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760
Masturbating Monkeys.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.820
Alright, you know what, it's not over yet.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.810
Two out of three, okay.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.840
Imran, you can pull this out.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.710
Who's it gonna be?

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.840
I'm going to have to agree with my colleagues.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.760
Masturbating Monkeys.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.389
Masturbation is so spiritual,
but so is working on your own home.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.500
With home improvement supplies from,
You Tool.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.180
Are you kidding me?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.570
Three Masturbating Monkeys?

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.040
They're really good.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.380
Tracey sang her heart out, okay?

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.380
I don't...

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.580
And she smells great.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.020
She's gonna be a star.

You know, Lazlow.

You wouldn't know talent if it stuck a finger
up your ass.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.100
She only tried that once.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.100
Alright!

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100
And I told her no!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.341
You know what, I've had enough of all of your
shit,

00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:37.740

You're not even fucking British!

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.740
I am totally British.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.740
I am so mate.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.740
Fuck you, asshole.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.740
Ahhh!

and twats!

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.660
Toes and twats!
