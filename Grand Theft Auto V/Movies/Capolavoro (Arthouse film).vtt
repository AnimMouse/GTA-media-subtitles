GTA V - Capolavoro (Arthouse film)
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/arthoau.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.950
Welcome to the cinema.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.320
No mobile phones.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:32.610
No talking or toddlers.
and please be considerate to your fellow movie

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.860
goers.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:45.370
No masturbating.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:59.300
Now sit back and enjoy the show.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.300
Antonio!

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
Antonio!

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Wake up!

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
Wake up!

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Why are you asleep?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.290
How can you be asleep?

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.120
I was not asleep.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.250
I was dreaming, but I was awake.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.290
Your life must be remarkable!

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.750
These dreams you have both awake and asleep,
but you're just a humble thief.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.250
The war made me a whore and you a thief, or
was it the other way around?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310
Freud has a lot to answer for!

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.310
Who said that?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.310
Where are you?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.310
Show yourself!

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.310
Antonio, what are you talking about?

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Please, Antonio.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.310
Please.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.310
That voice...

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.310
You mean me?

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.310
Yes.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.310
You-Maria-you heard her.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310
Who was that?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.310
Antonio, what has gotten into you lately?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.310
Since Luigi's death, you're really not yourself.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.310
If you say so my dear.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.310
If it makes you happy, you say so.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.310
I married a thief.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.310
A good, honest thief, who knew his place in
life.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.310
Now, now I am stuck with a... with a hermaphrodite.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
A creature who no longer knows if he is a
man or woman.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:26.819
Which is the lie and which is the half told
truth?

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.959
Why must things always be so simple but so
endlessly complicated with you Antonio?

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.159
Yes, Maria, with you things...

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.370
they are not so complicated.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.650
The butcher comes,
you open your legs.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.390
The police comes to arrest me,
you open your legs.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.959
The priest comes for confession, again.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.250
We know the outcome.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:14.140
You'd like to see yourself as a victim, Antonio.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.140
But in this life, we are only prisoners of
the jails we ourselves construct.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.420
For a street walker and a faithless wife,
you have a very ambiguous turn of phrase.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.959
She never loved you, Antonio.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:25.959
Who?

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.040
Who never loved me?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.209
That I do not know.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.379
I'm just a voice that only exists in your
head.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.379
What are you talking about Antonio?

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:41.019
As my mother told me about you,
The breathless extent of your dream life is

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.019
a burden
too many on the prosaic reality of our day

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.019
to day physical reality.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.019
Maria, Maria, Maria, my precious Maria.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.019
Your mother, forgive me, but I will not forgive
myself if I do not confess.

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.019
She was a very ugly woman with a soul she
had stolen from the Devil.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.590
Shame on you, Antonio
and your wretched and primal subconscious

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.590
inadequacies.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.590
Antonio, Antonio.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.590
Wake up.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.590
Wake Up.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.250
Shut up - you're just a voice in my head.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.529
Let me dream in peace.

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:20.160
Is that what you wish to reduce all of these
women to, Antonio?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.570
A reductive analysis of the feminine is a
classical archetype of your repression.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.360
Oh for fuck's sake,
stop sounding like my wife when she's not

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.410
paying the rent on her back.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.410
Your wife?

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.080
Is that who I am now?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.090
I hope not.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.030
Perhaps I am Luigi?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.640
After your treachery castrated him -
have we considered that yet?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.670
We have considered it off camera many times.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.180
We considered modernism.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.690
We predicted post-modernism.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.710
We have embraced surrealism.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.220
We have refuted the technocratic vision of
mankind's future.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.820
So much wonderment have we embraced.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.540
That I am left in awe of the Italian education
system.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.670
I was taught by priests.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.070
And yet I know every blasphemy under the sun
and revolving around the room.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.850
Oh Antonio, now it is you who sounds like
your wife.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.010
Perhaps it is your innermost desire
to be hammered night and day by the butchers

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.850
and priests and policemen.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.540
You suggest I wish to lie with another man
because I long to make things and hate myself

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.050
for my destructive tendencies?

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.830
I think that is a little simplistic.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.220
Even for the subconscious of a humble thief.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.630
Humility is like heaven for men such as you
-

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.470
massively over rated.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.630
You should embrace hell.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.960
At least you will know some people there.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.040
Like Luigi.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.210
Shut up about Luigi!

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.640
He wasn't even a good man!

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.660
Well, we can all justify the embodiment of
our fall.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.200
Even Icarus did that,
As he plummeted into the Azure Mediterranean.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.030
Classicism in thinking is the great weakness
of the contemporary soul.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:13.120
So you admit you have a soul?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.620
I am communist, a thief and a man of the people.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.800
Souls are means by which the ruling class
imprison us.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.870
What is that thing again?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.870
What thing?

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.870
Liberal use of deus ex machina!

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.870
What?

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.870
Oh!

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.870
Luigi!

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.870
I thought you were dead.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.870
You killed me,
but I forgive you in the sense that I do not

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.870
exist any longer.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.870
So immortality is a myth?

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.870
We are nothing but the physical embodiment
of our own neuroses?

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.330
Your wife told me that
while she digested my sword in the marital

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.330
bed.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Is that the truth?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.590
The underlying anxiety of my reality?

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.680
That what I justified by expediency
was really the manifestation of the horns

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.750
on my cuckold's head?

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.400
How can you ask such questions of a ghost?

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.200
The eagle that hears the whizz of an arrow
as it strikes its heart

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:14.520
sees that the arrow has been feathered with
its own plumes.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.910
What a fine horse this is, Antonio!

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:23.060
It's not a horse.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.349
It's my life.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:36.570
A man with such physical simplicity is a man
I can indeed respect.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:43.010
You mean that it is my ability to negate humanity
by robbing and over powering my fellow creatures

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.150
that I create the respect of you a beautiful
woman I stumbled across?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.330
No - she means that in your shallowness you
have yet again

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.460
sublimed the feminine into the masculine desire
ideal form.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.190
As my mother predicted you would.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.220
It is a common mistake amongst traitors.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.810
And among sinners!

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.990
And the repressed!

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:12.300
It is only by creative expression,
A world devoid of color, and unique camera

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.500
angles,
That our true nature can be revealed.
