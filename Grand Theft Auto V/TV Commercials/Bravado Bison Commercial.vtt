For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:03.600
Agh, agh...
What's the sound of that screaming?&nbsp;

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.560
We just gave birth to a Bison.
The Bravado Bison.&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.640
The truck that tamed the west.
The Bravado Bison.&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.400
Your two tons of muscle and sinew.
You can't be stopped,&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.240
so plow through life!
Never stop for directions.&nbsp;

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.720
Haul stuff.
Haul ass!&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.160
Haul Migrants.
This is the west.&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000
This is America.
Where you can fight through any emotional terrain,&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.280
with raw four by four power,
with six-thousand horse power&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.320
and fuel efficiency that's&nbsp;
great for the environment.&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.800
Isn't it time we reintroduced the Bison?
The good die young,&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
so you might as well die strong...
in a real truck!&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.520
The Bravado Bison...
believe in beef.
