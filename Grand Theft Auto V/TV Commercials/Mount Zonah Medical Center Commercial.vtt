00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.940
When my dad had a heart attack...

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.310
We rushed him to Central Los Santos Hospital.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.300
I was so scared.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.010
Thanks to the treatment he received there,
he unfortunately died.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.900
My family learned our lesson,
that place sucks!

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.550
Heart attacks won't kill you.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.630
The wrong choice in hospitals will!

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.029
Take your loved one to Mount Zonah Medical
Center.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.270
Mount Zonah is number one in heart attacks,
brain hemorrhages,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.300
tourettes,
"Fuck, shit, cunt!",

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.820
strokes,
hemorrhoids,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.340
leprosy,
elephantitis,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.480
cardiac failure,
and loose stools.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.980
You have a choice in hospitals,
so pick the one with the largest advertising

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.980
budget.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.359
Mount Zonah Medical Center.
