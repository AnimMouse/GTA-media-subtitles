GTA V - Gordon Moorehead Rides Again
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/mooreau.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.270
Criminals fear him.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.760
Police respect him.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.350
Women need him.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.770
Men envy him.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.400
He's the square-jawed, yet world-weary hero
your dad always wanted to be.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080
He's the diamond in the rough.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.309
Fighting crime by breaking rules
that haven't been written yet.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.859
He's even, when appropriate,
seen with ethnics and women.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
The Bald Eagle Broadcasting System presents
Gordon Moorehead in...

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.599
Moorehead Rides Again!

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.769
He smokes sixty a day.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.939
He drinks a quarter dry at lunch.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.700
He has incredible powers of reasoning.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.260
And he keeps America safe when government
intervention cannot.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.240
Sleep easy America,
someone else is worrying about things so you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.730
don't have to.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.940
This episode of Moorehead Rides Again is brought
to you by

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.219
Los Santos Affordable Homes
and Redwood Tobacco.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.769
Before we start this week's episode of Moorehead
Rides Again

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.480
we would like to tell you about a remarkable
free offer.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.789
You can own an incredible genuine
Gordon Moorehead detective badge,

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.739
replica gun,
and packet of candy cigarettes.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.740
So you can help protect your neighborhood
the same way Gordon protects America.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
All you need to do is
get your dad or uncle to write a check for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.280
ten dollars.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.560
Send it in
and you'll be sent a certificate of graduation

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.050
from the
Moorehead School of Investigation.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.040
Along with your badge,
gun,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.090
and smokes.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490
Work real crimes.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.890
Solve murders.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.079
Kill people with impunity.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.630
And smoke!

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.829
Just like a real crime fighter.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.259
Or sit on your couch wishing you had
a dad who really loved you

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.972
and a future as something other than a ninny.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:38.972
And now...

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:39.972
Moorehead Rides Again!

00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:40.972
In Moorehead and the Soviet Tit Wank
Or...

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:43.570
Reds under the Bed.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.280
Read all about it!

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.979
Read all about it!

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.369
Soviet spies corrupting the nation.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.070
Read all about it!

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.479
Communists ruining your family,
sleeping with your wife,

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.210
pleasuring her better than you ever could.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.920
Read all about it!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.220
Molly, come in here
and bring me some napalm.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.879
Gordon, I'm right here.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.380
We're on TV now.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.710
Besides, we moved to the west coast,
we don't need napalm anymore.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.730
That's for clearing out the swamps of Vice
City

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.480
and setting bad guys on fire.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760
Exactly, toots.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.519
Which is why I was checking if you're paying
attention.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.470
It's not your fault you're slow,
you're made for making babies

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.370
and I'm made to think about
making babies with you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.950
from behind while solving impossible crimes.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.340
Boy, do I miss old Pablo.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.970
What a sidekick, we solved some great crimes
together.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.319
I think you're lying, you son of a bitch.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.599
No, please no!

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.770
Ai, he is hot like a tamale!

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.850
Get me a marshmallow.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.769
Oh, those were the days.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.580
Get that, will you?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.950
Of course, Gordon.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
Oh, Gordon, I'm so happy we moved
from the swamps of Vice Beach to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.560
the desert paradise of Los Santos.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.459
Where American ingenuity
and just a little Canadian water

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.599
has turned the harsh desert into a
beautiful and very natural paradise of...

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.709
golf clubs,
sprinkler systems,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.709
beautiful fruit farms and hydro-electrical
dams.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.010
Filled with happy families and all the glamor
of Vinewood.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.549
Ooh, this place really is paradise, Gordon.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.819
Huh, silly me.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.920
And don't forget,
starter homes are very attractively priced

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920
here.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.280
And I enjoyed a very exciting two hour traffic
jam

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.110
after doing calisthenics on the beach.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.180
Exercise can be very dangerous for a woman,
Molly.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.379
If you lose an ounce of that cushion
men will never court you.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.410
A man wants a woman with some thickness to
her

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.280
so she won't die during childbirth.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.459
Oh, you're right again, Gordon.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.750
Oh, Gordon, this place is like a dream.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.530
Umm, even paradise has a dark side.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.019
Is that a Redwood you're smoking, Gordon?

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.019
Yes!

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.200
A Redwood, it's a vigorous cigarette
that nine out of ten physicians recommend.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.120
All-American tobacco, of course.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.690
Smooth, sophisticated,
yet passionate and caring.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.569
A woman in your hands
and a tiger in your lungs.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.280
Great while relaxing in a hospital,
or while playing tennis,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.490
or yachting.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.700
Oh, Lord!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.910
Who's that?

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.120
Quiet, broad!

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120
How!

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.190
Hello, red skin.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.379
Aren't you on the wrong show?

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.689
I am, but actors contracts are umm...
complicated things.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.440
And central casting ordered a chief
I... uhh... come from reservation.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.660
We lived there like kings.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.380
But something has come to Los Santos
that will disturb umm peace between white

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.920
man and Indian.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.750
Ah, if only Pablo were here.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.040
With his Mexican cunning
he could make sense of what

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.650
this indigenous savage is going on about.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.840
No Pablo?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.630
He big problem.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.550
Chief, another chief.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.100
That's right, Pablo's a hell of a problem.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.820
He's a Goddamn communist.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.180
Our Pablo?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.540
Yes, squaw.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.370
Through many moons,
our peoples have lived happily together.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.580
We simple savages were honored to give up
our land,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.390
so dregs from Europe build mid-west chain
restaurants

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.910
kill ninety percent of our people and herd
us in to tiny pens.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.800
Only letting us out to drink firewater
and work construction jobs.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.280
But now all this bliss has been ruined.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.560
Say, pale face.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.830
Got them Redwood?

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.410
Yes, I'd like a Redwood cigarette as well.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.980
Perfect for chiefs of all kinds, everywhere.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.631
For gentlemen from all walks of life.

00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:23.631
Umm... how!

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:28.660
I'd like one too, but they're too manly for
me.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.660
Damn straight, chippy.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.500
Hey, I don't understand what Pablo has to
do with all this.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.180
The red skin says something terrible is coming.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.060
He thinks it's communism, Gordon,
and he's not happy about it.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.580
His people could smell this stuff in the wind.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.560
This... umm... land of freedom,
not land to share equally.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.620
What he's trying to say, Gordon,
is this is a land of freedom,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.140
not a land to share equally.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.280
I-I don't understand?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280
Ooow...

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.220
Being a woman I can't help but
stick my nose in where it doesn't belong

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.820
and amble cluelessly through life.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.090
Can I fix you gentlemen a drink?

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.590
Damn straight you can, woman.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.600
Two scotches and a ceremonial bowl of water
for the chief.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600
I'm on wagon.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.000
I'd use the local police force, but
the fact is, Gordon, they're useless.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.430
No existentialist crime fighters like yourself.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.430
Men with an addiction to justice,
they're much better at fighting evil

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.570
than government fat cats and bloated examples
of America's descent into decadence.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.570
Amen.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.370
We think that the commies have infiltrated
the moving pictures.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.880
Writing subversive themes and scripts
to influence our children and women.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.020
The fact is, there's only one kind of red
we like in this country.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.580
A red skin who knows his place and
wears feathers a lot while having very little

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.910
understanding of syntax.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.350
Not Goddamn communists!

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.550
There's communists?

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.740
In Vinewood?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.900
Oh, but this used to be a nice country.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.900
Oh, Gordon I'm scared.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.640
I'm scared too, Molly,
of what I'll do when I catch them.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.360
Me scalp 'em big nasty.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.590
Alright, alright, alright...

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.590
Simmer down.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.590
Sorry.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.400
We'll have to find a way
to sneak on to that motion picture studio

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.960
lot
and have a look around, see?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.940
I knew I could count on you.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.020
Who better to protect America than
a drunk,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.210
a dame,
and a sensitive portrayal of indigenous people?

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.940
How about we smoke on peace pipe?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.940
Oh yeah.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.320
I'm in.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.530
Okay, alright.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.530
Let's get out of here.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.330
I know exactly where to start.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.490
Are we going to the movie studio?

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.110
No Molly, we're going in here.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.020
Can't start a case without a fisted gin.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.610
Helps a man think.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.000
Now, where to find these pinkos?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.510
Hey there partner, where you from?

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.830
Oh, I'm from...

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.830
Georgia.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.840
Oh, I do love a peach.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.360
Yeah, I'm real American.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.470
I sleep with sister and...

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.580
And finger sheep.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.950
Well, no time to dilly dally.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.460
I've got to solve this case,
and I know just how to get into that movie

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.460
lot.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.460
Hey, Joey.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.580
Look what I snuck from my old man.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.580
Gadzooks, Nancy.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580
He'll be cross for sure.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.580
You'll get a serious spanking.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580
Nah, he only spanks Mommy.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.890
Why should he enjoy all this refreshing flavor?

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:55.890
Yay!

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.180
I love you forever, Redwood cigarettes.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.860
When Daddy's not looking,
grab that pack.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.270
Don't worry about that
cough or hack.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.550
Time to smoke, smoke, smoke really good.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.310
It's got to be that filter tip...

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.310
Redwood.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.310
Yeah.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:24.030
Smoking is just as fun for kids
as it is for parents.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.590
Have a Redwood.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:43.201
Don't let adults have all the fun.

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.201
Halt!

00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:45.201
Where are you going?

00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:46.201
Look the other way, pal.

00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:47.201
We're fighting communists.

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:48.201
Oh!

00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:49.201
I hate these communists.

00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:50.201
They killed my father.

00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:51.201
In Stalingrad.

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:57.050
Look in the writer's room -
I hear the filthy socialists often meet there.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.570
Oh, Gordon!

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.090
I'm scared.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.090
Shut up!

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.090
You'll blow our cover.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.090
I'm sorry Gordon.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.240
Estrogen makes me weak-minded.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.390
Let's not waste time.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.890
We haven't got a moment to lose on dull exposition
or silly plot points.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.030
I wanna go straight to the boss of this place.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.950
Vinewood is full of harlots and charlatans,
and socialist scum.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:24.190
And I wanna know who is pulling the strings.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.390
We need to have a chat, bucko.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.480
You've been over doing the firewater again,
huh?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.180
We can't afford to pay your kind for movie
work.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.200
We're losing money...

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.490
This is...

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.490
Advertising money.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.130
I'm no sitting bull, big chief pile of cash.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.210
I'm Gordon Moorehead,
crime fighter,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.000
and I'm hunting commies, see?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Huh!

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I knew it!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Those aren't mine.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.520
They belong to the maintenance man.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.800
A likely story.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.840
Blaming the honest poor.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.340
I'm sorry Mr. Zelder.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.920
I forgot my artificial hand.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.060
You slipped by this time,
but I'm convinced you're running

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.240
a massive propaganda operation here.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.560
One that's hell bent into turning this country
into bunch of weak minded,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.300
overly considerate,
Lenin lovers.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300
Hey!

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.650
That's a bold faced lie.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.920
Actors and movie executives would never
push a liberal agenda.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.680
We studio bosses are too busy
counting money all day and

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.090
sleeping with young starlets to care about
the dread we're putting out.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.140
What you need to do is visit the writer's
room.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.520
Yes, that's what you should do.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.880
What I need to do is...

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.350
Get this young lady out from under my desk.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.130
No teeth, damn it!

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.140
Sorry, Mr. Zelder, I didn't mean it.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.990
Oh Gordon, this is so scary.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.990
Shut up!

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.800
I'm running out of places to slap you.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.220
We're fighting a red menace here.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.010
We've got no time for emotion.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.800
What did you do during the war, Gordon?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.900
I fought fascism.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.470
In Germany, Italy?

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.030
No, dumbass, Florida.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.110
Now shut your yap.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.150
We're here.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.150
Gadzooks!

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.270
Someone's making monkeys of us.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.500
There must be another writer's room.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.920
Don't worry.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.770
I will track 'em.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.190
Over there.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.960
You're incredible,
you savage.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.640
Pablo.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.790
That's not Pablo!

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.790
Yes it is.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.880
Igor Pablovich, rusky at large.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880
Comrades.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.910
You're too late.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:14.830
Already I have flooded your movies with
communist propaganda.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.830
Your workers will...

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.780
They will rise up,
unionize the men's ridiculous wages,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:25.120
then all the American industry will fail
and move to communist China!

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.000
It's good plan, no?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.660
Oh, oh please.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.320
Oh, that is rich!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.840
America will always be a pillar of industry.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.420
We're unstoppable.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.680
Our hunger and work ethic make us invincible.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.340
As if America would ever become
fat,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.080
lazy,
and entitled like you commies.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.190
And besides...

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.250
I'm about to stop you!

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:58.430
Oh, that horrible,
awful foreigner's getting away.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.080
Get him, Gordon.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080
No!

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.610
Bye, bye comrades.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.260
I fall down.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.260
Pablo.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.440
Hola, senor Moorehead,
Hola, Miss Malmstein.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.740
Oh, Pablo, where have you been?

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.510
I stopped for siesta and to have a burrito.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.220
Such a cunning people.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.240
They nap half the day and
mix the same four ingredients

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.920
and give it twenty different names.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.170
Can I get a Chimichanga?

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.710
Gordon, I bring you a present.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.410
But Pablo, Friendly's no longer a sponsor
of this show.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.290
Sí, but this is old script.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.290
Muy viejo.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.380
Well, in that case,
give me a Redwood,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.779
buy me a starter home,
and stand the hell back.

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:54.260
These people are about to be put on the cutting
room floor.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.020
I guess weeding out trouble never goes out
of style.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.020
How, muchacho.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:07.320
And I guess I, would like a Redwood.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.590
Join us next time for more adventures,
with Gordon,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.580
Molly and the gang,
as they protect America's atomic secrets

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.690
by setting some off.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.740
Only on...

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.880
Moorehead Rides Again.
