00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
There are over eight million species of&nbsp;
migratory birds that travel through San Andreas.&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.560
but every day hundreds of thousands of birds&nbsp;
are slaughtered by a not so silent predator.&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.940
Windmills&nbsp;

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
So-called environmentalists' desperate need to&nbsp;
destroy our state's indigenous oil industry,&nbsp;

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
will lead to noisy, nature killing windmills,
literally in your backyard!&nbsp;

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.820
At San Andreas Water and Power,
we're working with state and local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
officials to make sure that windmills
and solar panels don't ruin our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
pristine environment.
Let's keep the power on!&nbsp;

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.880
Nature, and in particular our&nbsp;
beautiful birds will thank you.&nbsp;

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.840
Nothing is more dangerous for a&nbsp;
bird than a slow moving windmill.&nbsp;

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.540
They, like any half sentient creature,
much prefer one hundred acre industrial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.580
plants spewing out noxious chemicals.
Let's all work together to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.780
preserve our environment.
San Andreas Water and Power.
