GTA V - Impotent Rage: The Liberal Superhero
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/rageaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.880
Impotent Rage, the liberal superhero.
He'll save the day for straight or gay.&nbsp;

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.630
Impotent Rage
Tax the rich, rob the poor.&nbsp;

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.250
Even though he funnels money offshore.
Impotent Rage&nbsp;

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.640
Getting an award, in a jet plane.
We're sacrificing together, I feel your pain!&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.690
Impotent Rage
Eat organic, recycle or I'll have a fit!&nbsp;

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.250
He's a judgemental hypocrite.
Union entitlements rule!&nbsp;

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.830
Ban God in School!
Smack for junkies!&nbsp;

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.426
Welfare for flunkies!
Impotent Rage&nbsp;

00:00:35.426 --> 00:00:36.470
The liberal superhero.
I just care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.521
too much!
What do we want?&nbsp;

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:42.550
Less work!
When do we want it?&nbsp;

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.570
Now!
What do we want?&nbsp;

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:55.210
Hand jobs!
Everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.730
get back to work.
What the hell is this?&nbsp;

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.691
Get back to work!
Impotent Rage.&nbsp;

00:00:58.691 --> 00:00:58.719
Impotent Rage.
Impotent Rage.&nbsp;

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.747
Impotent Rage.
Impotent Rage.&nbsp;

00:00:58.747 --> 00:00:58.799
Impotent Rage, Rage, Rage!
Safety first!&nbsp;

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:17.845
Hey fellas.
What's going on here?&nbsp;

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.740
Oh, Impotent Rage!
Thank god you're here!&nbsp;

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.150
We're being oppressed by an evil corporation.
Our bosses want us to actually work.&nbsp;

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.100
And won't guarantee us two-hundred percent raises.
Summer Fridays off and pensions for life after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.980
retiring at thirty-seven.
Why... that's outrageous!&nbsp;

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.360
But we're going out of business&nbsp;
if we don't make some changes.&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.230
They want free snacks,
massages and raises every year!&nbsp;

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.350
Then most of them go on&nbsp;
disability with full pay anyway.&nbsp;

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.950
You revolting chisellers you!
He tried to fire me for sleeping at my desk.&nbsp;

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.650
You were drunk!
Why you would be too!&nbsp;

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.500
He's just dampening the pain inside,
from being trapped as a mediocre cog&nbsp;

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.390
in the dead end machine of capitalism.
But he's the CFO!&nbsp;

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
I said American workers should be able to retire&nbsp;
at age of thirty-five and receive healthcare...&nbsp;

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.420
And a salary for life,
on your dime!&nbsp;

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.360
Otherwise...
What's the point?&nbsp;

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.450
That's impossible!
That's not how economics work.&nbsp;

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.420
Don't you understand?
I'm extremely rich!&nbsp;

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.860
I understand how economics work,
and what the working class needs!&nbsp;

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.410
They want a six-pack of beer.
Yeah!&nbsp;

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.380
An eager girl in their pickup truck!
Yeah!&nbsp;

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.430
And a depressing folk tune playing on the radio!
Uhh, yes...&nbsp;

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.090
This here's a free country, boy!
Free!&nbsp;

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.650
But with thousands of rules and regulations.
To keep greedy corporations like you in line!&nbsp;

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.280
If you don't like it...
Move to China!&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.050
But... But because of the free trade agreement,
that's where we'll have to move the company&nbsp;

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.830
if we don't wanna go out of business.
We just want a sensible discussion of the issues.&nbsp;

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.950
Oh, you're nothing short of a disgrace!
If peaceful protest won't change your mind,&nbsp;

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.310
we're going to have to solve&nbsp;
this the old fashioned way.&nbsp;

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.545
With mind,&nbsp;

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:11.950
bending,
liberal,&nbsp;

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:22.730
impotent...
Rage!&nbsp;

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.590
A victory for the working man.
My work here is done.&nbsp;

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.280
But our work place is destroyed.
Ah hell, go on welfare.&nbsp;

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.742
Kick back, get a six pack and relax.
You deserve it after all this work.&nbsp;

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:47.640
What if we just wanna work?
Braxton Industries headed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.560
billionaire liberal playboy Braxton Hunter,
recently celebrated the closing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.660
another highway,
to install more bike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.890
lanes and collective urban farms.
Braxton recently returned from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.400
trip to Antarctica on his private jumbo jet,
where he'd been to accept an environmental award.&nbsp;

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.750
Some critics say that Hunter is also&nbsp;
the caped superhero Impotent Rage.&nbsp;

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.320
Because they look exactly alike,
and have the same voice&nbsp;

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.480
and Impotent Rage tends to show up right&nbsp;
after Mr. Hunter quietly sneaks out.&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.750
He has emphatically denied&nbsp;
they're the same person.&nbsp;

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.990
A hero of the liberal media,
others say Hunter is a rich, entitled asshole&nbsp;

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.900
with too much time on his hands.
What?&nbsp;

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.670
I am not a rich entitled asshole!
With too much time on my hands...&nbsp;

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.380
Woo baby!
Now that is one productive day's work!&nbsp;

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.110
I'm gonna go home and do some yoga,
drink some wheat grass&nbsp;

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.980
and go to my favorite farmers' market.
Good morning Braxton, you look great.&nbsp;

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.966
You've got a bunch of voicemail messages.
Yeah, yeah, from who?&nbsp;

00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:51.982
Uberman.
Uberman!&nbsp;

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:52.027
My arch-nemesis!
I hate that right wing bully!&nbsp;

00:04:52.027 --> 00:05:07.950
Hey Impotent Rage, you pathetic hypocrite.
I was just eating some whale sashimi&nbsp;

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.010
and a manatee steak when&nbsp;
my thoughts turned to you.&nbsp;

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.480
Dumb,
slow,&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.040
vegetarians who the state will no longer protect.
See you around smucko.&nbsp;

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.283
Oh, do I hate that man!
Oh, do I despise him.&nbsp;

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:24.540
Oh, Braxton, Braxton, there, there...
I know a way to calm you down.&nbsp;

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.820
Something wet and relaxing.
That you'll really like...&nbsp;

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.470
Oh, a flaxseed smoothie.
You've got a great idea, baby.&nbsp;

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.190
Braxton, I need to tell you something.
I'm in love with you.&nbsp;

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.310
I want you to take me,
rip my clothes off and&nbsp;

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.790
thrust yourself inside me.
Sometimes I feel like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.310
don't even notice I'm here.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?&nbsp;

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:53.620
Oh, it's ok, it's ok.
I get emotional about this stuff too, Violet.&nbsp;

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.480
The environment,
marriage rights,&nbsp;

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.820
hemp clothing,
recycling,&nbsp;

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.630
placenta cakes!
You know, I became a liberal at a very young age.&nbsp;

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.240
My parents were...
Violet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.580
we're about to start the flashback sequence,
so please wiggle back and forth for me, now.&nbsp;

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.010
Okay.
My parents moved here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.460
as immigrants from Vice City,
and built a huge empire&nbsp;

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.230
exploiting people mercilessly.
My father made a fortune strip mining,&nbsp;

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.120
whaling,
dumping toxic pollution&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.120
and marketing tobacco.
He was a womanizer,&nbsp;

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.380
and much more interesting than me.
He belittled me constantly.&nbsp;

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.680
And then he died before he&nbsp;
could write me out of his will.&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.070
And so I became the majority shareholder
in a huge multinational company!&nbsp;

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.720
I traveled the world.
I joined lots of NGOs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.040
did what any other impossibly rich,
sexually confused rich kid does...&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.870
Became a superhero!
Through the art of self-meditation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.840
yoga and a freak green energy accident
which gave me unnatural God-like powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.340
I became...
Impotent Rage,&nbsp;

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.989
rage, rage, rage, rage...
Wait, what's that?&nbsp;

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:14.140
What is it?
It's my eco sense going off.&nbsp;

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.360
That man isn't recycling!
Hey!&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.420
Neanderthal!
Do you know what century it is?&nbsp;

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.050
Recycle that soda can,
or I'll come down there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:38.185
teach you a lesson you won't forget in a hurry!
I can't stand being disrespected like this!&nbsp;

00:07:38.185 --> 00:07:41.785
Fuck, shit, cunt, piece of...
Braxton, quick to the anger room!&nbsp;

00:07:41.785 --> 00:08:04.330
Wow, oh my God.
All this relentless self-righteous posturing.&nbsp;

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.470
It's exhausting...
It's exhausting!&nbsp;

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.180
What is it, high-tech device of&nbsp;
the future I personally invented,&nbsp;

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.250
even though I'm otherwise entirely incompetent?
Impotent Rage, there's some trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.950
down by the river.
Fascism never sleeps!&nbsp;

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.320
Violet!
I'm over here.&nbsp;

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.130
Of course you are!
Why are you wearing that ridiculous outfit?&nbsp;

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.620
I thought superheroes run&nbsp;
around in their underwear,&nbsp;

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.010
so should their assistants.
I thought you would like it.&nbsp;

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.940
Violet, it's that kind of&nbsp;
hyper-sexualized clothing&nbsp;

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.969
that exploits and demeans women.
Fuck me!&nbsp;

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:40.000
Fuck me!
Time for Impotent Rage!&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.670
Where is it?
Here.&nbsp;

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.980
For the record, this is an organic,
entirely fair trade,&nbsp;

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.680
cotton one piece that is dyed in berry juice,
harvested by a lesbian commune.&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.450
And it's every bit as effective at fighting crime
as the synthetic fibres made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.770
popular by some of my rivals.
Quick, to the suit-up montage.&nbsp;

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.140
Ah, Braxton...
What's this?&nbsp;

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.430
That's the cost to animate your overly&nbsp;
elaborate and lengthy suit-up montage.&nbsp;

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.250
Ah... got it,
Okay, skip the montage.&nbsp;

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.688
Let's go straight to...
Impotent Rage!&nbsp;

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:29.800
Impotent Rage
will be back after these commercials.&nbsp;

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:39.230
There are over eight million species of&nbsp;
migratory birds that travel through San Andreas.&nbsp;

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:45.470
but every day hundreds of thousands of birds&nbsp;
are slaughtered by a not so silent predator.&nbsp;

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.020
Windmills
So-called environmentalists' desperate need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.660
to destroy our state's indigenous oil industry,
will lead to noisy, nature killing windmills,&nbsp;

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.360
literally in your backyard!
At San Andreas Water and Power,&nbsp;

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.470
we're working with state and local&nbsp;
officials to make sure that windmills&nbsp;

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.740
and solar panels don't ruin&nbsp;
our pristine environment.&nbsp;

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.960
Let's keep the power on!
Nature, and in particular our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.710
beautiful birds will thank you.
Nothing is more dangerous for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.780
a bird than a slow moving windmill.
They, like any half sentient creature,&nbsp;

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.340
much prefer one hundred acre industrial&nbsp;
plants spewing out noxious chemicals.&nbsp;

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.180
Let's all work together to&nbsp;
preserve our environment.&nbsp;

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.640
San Andreas Water and Power.
No more fracking!&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.890
No more fracking!
No more fracking!&nbsp;

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.340
No more fracking!
No more fracking!&nbsp;

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.680
What's going on here?
These protesters wanna stop us from fracking!&nbsp;

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.070
You conservatives!
Always trying to stop loving people from fracking,&nbsp;

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.230
what century are you living in?
If these three men want to frack each other,&nbsp;

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.270
what business is it of yours!
If these two want to spit roast this guy,&nbsp;

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.640
why do I care?
What?&nbsp;

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:17.440
But they wanna drill really deep and make a mess.
Why, they say that's the joy of fracking!&nbsp;

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.790
Why I'll bet this happy fellow is a top.
I say what?&nbsp;

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:28.570
Fracking is what makes the world go round.
Everyone is free to frack who they want,&nbsp;

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:34.450
what they want and where they want.
I myself would frack all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.220
if it weren't that my super powers
have inversely affected my fracking prowess.&nbsp;

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:45.490
Oh, yeah. I do love big, delicious penises.
You have to help us Impotent Rage,&nbsp;

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.450
we're being oppressed.
I've had about enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.880
of your Stone Age outrage.
You angry conservatives are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.230
all pent-up homosexuals yourselves!
Okay, but we're not conservatives.&nbsp;

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.365
We're protesters.
Argh!&nbsp;

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:01.347
Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing?&nbsp;

00:12:01.347 --> 00:12:01.370
Argh!
There!&nbsp;

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:15.770
That should sort things out for everyone.
You just keep on fracking boys!&nbsp;

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.670
Does anyone want a photo,&nbsp;
for their Lifeinvader page?&nbsp;

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:26.660
I really do exist.
And I prove not all closeted rich guys are creepy.&nbsp;

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:33.830
Oh, Impotent Rage,
you're such an ignoramus.&nbsp;

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.610
Uberman!
You littering pig!&nbsp;

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:44.060
I was wondering when you'd turn up.
Oh, my suit is so fancy.&nbsp;

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:49.040
This suit is actually pleasuring me right now.
Oh, oh, who's your daddy?&nbsp;

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.050
Who's your daddy?
Yang!&nbsp;

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.620
You've worked yourself up&nbsp;
in to such a liberal lather,&nbsp;

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.320
that you actually ended up helping the opposition.
These are natural gas wells that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.010
pollute the environment.
Not three old queens in to PNP.&nbsp;

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.270
What?
Oh no! No! What have I done?&nbsp;

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:13.970
Maybe I'll donate some money to charities.
Build a statue of a kid in a wheel chair.&nbsp;

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.380
That will clear my conscience.
I've come to save the day again...&nbsp;

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.260
from you.
The common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.330
herd needs a genetically superior, synthetic&nbsp;
fiber clad, sociopath lunatic to look up to.&nbsp;

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:31.790
Not a soy latte sipping dweeb with a flaccid...
Well, you get the point.&nbsp;

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:37.970
But first, I'm off to drill some oil wells&nbsp;
in environmentally sensitive wetlands.&nbsp;

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.930
Goodbye Impotent Rag.
No!&nbsp;

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:47.240
I must stop him.
To the Impotent Mobile electric car.&nbsp;

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:53.720
Initiate solar panel sequence.
Right away.&nbsp;

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:15.190
Oh... God!
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!&nbsp;

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:20.110
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
Why must the conservatives always win?
