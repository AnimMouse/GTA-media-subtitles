From https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Pi%C3%9Fwasser
For Anim's Gaming Mouse
We should use update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/binkaud.gxt2 instead, because it is canonical.

00:00:01.242 --> 00:00:04.301
Wake up the morning, drop a big ol' log

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:07.761
Out here, you ain't got time for nothing fruity like a jog

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:12.690
Marry a fat bitch, and die workin' like a dog!

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.210
Cowboys in the heartland, bankers in the city

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.689
We love cars, guns and big ol' plastic titties!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.660
Lets grab a case of Pißwasser and drink for
the U.S.A.!

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.660
Woo!
[Neigh]

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.440
Hey neighbors I'm sorry, we're partyin' real butch

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.420
Ya oughta speak English if you like it here so much!

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.400
Not Spanish, or Chinese, or British, and no fucking Dutch!

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.888
Fuck the Dutch!

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.197
I said yeah, we're gonna keep them illegals out!

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.194
Guns and Pißwasser!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.020
Yeah, that's what the party's all about!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.820
[Oink!]

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.209
Getting real drunk, puking face down

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:03.959
Billying and bobbin' while every kid's in town!

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:04.459
[Ugh!]

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.137
Drinking Pißwasser, fighting, getting real shitfaced tonight!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.577
Yeah!

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.445
I'm a patriotic American, that's my national right!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.141
