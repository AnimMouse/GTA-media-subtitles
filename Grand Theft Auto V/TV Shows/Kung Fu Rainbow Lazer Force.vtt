GTA V - Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/kungaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.910
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.120
We're reclaiming the rainbow.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.160
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.330
The upper middle class superhero team,
that protects your innocence,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.500
any way they can.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
They are...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.190
Talullah,
Sebastian Kadden,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.530
Zoey,
Quota,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
and Dirk.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.010
We don't tolerate difference,
We're heterosexual virgins,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.010
Yeah!

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.070
Fighting evil in multi-colored
skintight

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.320
cutoffs and spandex.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320
Pow!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.320
I'm happy to wait.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.320
I don't even need to masturbate.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.280
I get off on the face of justice!

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.600
Sex is bad!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.690
And violence is good.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.780
Gonna save the neighborhood.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.329
From sex!

00:00:43.329 --> 00:01:01.000
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.190
And what does science teach us
that caused the dinosaurs to go extinct?

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.190
Tallulah?

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.250
A giant meteor?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370
No, not a giant meteor!

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.370
Oh.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.920
Sebastian Kadden?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
A huge flood?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
That's right, Sebastian.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.180
A giant flood!

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.940
That in fact destroyed the dinosaurs,
and the Romans!

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.690
Now, we as a civilization face an equally
devastating threat from the environment.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.330
Now, what is that threat, Quota?

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.400
Climate change?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.700
Correct, climate change.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.130
Ergo, a dangerous change in our immoral climate.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
That makes us stop caring about the
terrible menace that will alter the future

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.230
of civilization as we know it.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.230
Yes.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.230
I am talking about...

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.040
A football game.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.640
Now this weekend's big game against our arch-rivals,
Wickenberg Canyon High.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.770
These are evil,
evil people,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.200
that must be stopped!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.340
Next week, we'll move on to
the insect family and the important role

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.630
abstinence plays in their survival.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.610
You see family is important, people.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.129
And everyone in this school, is like, family.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.819
And that is why we don't sleep with each other.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.859
As incest is just icky!

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.209
Mr. Hitzman, did you really mean what you
said?

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.780
Oh, yes.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.670
Crickets do talk,
and they love waiting

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.299
for that special person to make
baby crickets with in a creative and loving

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.299
way.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.780
Now one day,
when I've mastered my inappropriate longings.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.200
I hope to meet an understanding, Mrs. Hitzman,
and have some little baby Hitzmans running

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
around.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.499
We'll probably get a nanny to play with them,
and help out around the house a bit.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.709
Perhaps he would be a strapping German boy,
with brown shirt and big muscles and...

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.769
An enigmatic laugh that said more than words
ever could.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.870
And then in summer time he'd work topless,
his Aryan sweat producing a glimmering sheen

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.930
off his sizable...

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.680
No, no, no, about the end of the world?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.129
Oh... yes of course,
but you guys are going to stop it.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:17.769
Observe, Wickenberg Canyon High.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.590
State funded.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.230
Ewww, oh my God.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.640
Eww.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.790
There are some
very dark things going on there,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.560
in the name of so-called science.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.150
In fact, our recent intel tells us they are...

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.370
Harvesting souls!

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.370
Ohhh!!

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.680
That's right.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.950
Millions of little souls called...

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.689
Stem cells!

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.019
Now team,
stem cells are harvested from

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.499
a pregnant woman's belly button.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.769
Near that smelly
disgusting hole,

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.459
thing they have down there.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.709
Is that called a vagina?

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.709
Yuck!

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.709
Don't even say it!

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.370
I believe the male member is much more
elegant and...

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.370
Surprising.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.340
One time I was playing a game of sword fights
with my...

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.340
Sir!

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
About saving the world.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340
Hum...

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.340
Yes, yes!

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.340
We have to stop them.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.960
You see, they want to build a mutant army
and give people extra arms and legs.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.850
So they can win at football and...
fondle your wives and daughters at the same

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.850
time.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.850
Really?

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.850
Really!

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.070
Hey, where's Dirk?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.010
Hey team!

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.860
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force, yeah!

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.280
Oh, Dirk.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.700
Oh, yeah.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.230
Sorry I'm tardy.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.660
I'm just so full of school spirit you know.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.260
Parvenu Hills rules!

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.260
Woo!

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.310
That's okay, Dirk.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.310
You're good at sports,
so we turn a collective blind eye

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.350
to your remedial level reading skills
And I can't read.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.350
I know you can't.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.660
Lack of basic manners,
mistreatment of class mates,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.190
and the fact that you're twenty-five years
old

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.730
and have yet to come close to graduating.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.470
Oh, thank you, Hillary.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.200
I mean Mr. Hitzman.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.500
Yes, I was just telling the team about some
of the terrible stuff that's been going on

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.500
at Wickenberg.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.310
Wickenberg can suck my nutsack,
them boners.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.310
Really?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.310
Can they?

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.310
I mean...

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.320
I mean, that won't be necessary Dirk.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.890
Unless it would save America?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.570
Now that would be controversial!

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.430
Maybe we should teach the controversy, Sebastian.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.780
Atheists don't like that sir.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.460
They like to present unproven theories
made up by degenerates and transsexuals

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.210
wearing dresses they call lab coats,
as if they're facts.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.200
Just like the fact that America is God's own
country

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.950
and our destiny is made manifest
just like the earlier settlers did

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.130
when they gave small pox to the heathens
so they could meet God quicker.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.340
Very good, Quota.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.590
Thank you sir.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.310
I hope to one day be elected president but
based on my ability and integrity,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.670
not some liberal agenda which loves Muslims.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.820
What a nice,
noble,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.820
kind ambition.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.700
Although I hope to high hell it never comes
true.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.740
Me too, sir!

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.580
I think I'll stick to basketball and
making people feel uncomfortable when

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.620
I talk to their daughter.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.140
I still don't have a date for the prom.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.410
That's my boy.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.810
And I do mean boy, in the most non-offensive
way possible.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.840
Now, back to Wickenburg.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.030
I need you to do some reconnaissance.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.680
Listen closely here's what I want...

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.490
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force...

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.480
Kung Fu Lazer Rainbow Force...

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.480
No!

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Reconnaissance.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.390
Go in your school clothes and report back.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.390
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.190
Oh my God.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.090
It's like a bomb went off!

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.090
I know.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.530
These people only have one home...

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.730
How repulsive.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.470
I imagine some of them share toilets.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.750
The very idea of putting my bottom
where someone else's bottom has been.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.750
Eeuww!

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.750
Eeuww!

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.750
Eeuww!

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.750
Hey, knock it off.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.750
We've got to keep an eye out for the enemy.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.750
Durr...

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.150
I ain't scared of them.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.960
Handout kids and pregnant girls.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.450
They can clean my butthole.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.810
Can they?

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.810
Louisa!

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.940
What are you doing here?

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.940
Who's she?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.940
One of our house cleaners.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.810
This is where I live.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.810
Here?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.810
This slum?

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.690
This is a nice neighborhood.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.700
Besides, you only pay me fifteen thousand
dollars a year.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.890
Now Louisa!

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.890
Shame-o on you-o.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.580
Don't go asking for handouts.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.280
My family has worked hard for what they've
got.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.850
Why don't you take the rest of the week off,
without pay and think about this little incident?

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.870
You're terrible!

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.340
Why do you say that?

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.730
You should have just fired her on the spot.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.280
Giving her time off,
she'll do what all poor people do.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.630
Abuse drugs and have another kid,
and I mean that compassionately.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.680
Oh my God!

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.370
Look at that!

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.870
Mortal sin at three o'clock.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.970
Hey!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.740
Stop right there.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.890
What's your problem?

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.630
We're heterosexual virgins...

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.490
And you're our problem.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.490
What?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.490
Why?

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.490
Don't push your luck kid!

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.040
I know how it goes,
you start by holding hands,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.230
and then it's a trip up and down the bases.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.330
Fingering the tush.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.960
Then you fire off a big home run,
and before you know it you've got a kid on

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.450
your hands
who's gonna live his whole life in prison.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.240
Yeah, spending my parents' tax dollars.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.140
We were only holding hands.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.500
I bet you smoke pot.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.690
Poor people love the pot!

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.590
No, I have asthma, thank you.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.890
I bet you pleasure yourself?

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.950
Sometimes, but what...

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.200
And what's this?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Pornography...

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200
Arghhh!

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.760
Amputee pornography!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.320
That's a statue from the museum,
from the Renaissance.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.769
What are you talking about?

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:37.219
You fool!

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.459
Museums are the worst.

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:42.139
Subsidized dens of sin,
leading people astray.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:46.470
My father says
we should stop subsidizing decadent culture

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.060
and
start supporting things that really matter,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.130
like the oil industry.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.130
Ah...

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.329
I think we already do that.

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:53.329
Shut up, pervert!

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:56.680
He wants to chop your arms off
and have sexual intercourse with you.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.939
We have pledged to wait,
and your indecency has just

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.790
offended these lovely impressionable girls.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.790
Yeah.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.149
I'm just a teenage boy...

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:05.550
You're a degenerate.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.550
You're a dickhead.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.860
Say that again...

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.089
We were only holding hands,
but we have made out once.

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:12.089
Agh!

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:13.089
No!

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:14.620
Look, look, I don't want a kid yet,
and I have masturbated.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.620
So what?

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.779
You are dickheads.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:21.699
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force!

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:24.740
He was leading you astray.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.010
And we saved you from a life of vice.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.010
And prostitution.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.480
And picking up cigarette butts, looking for
a fix.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.870
If she isn't a street walker already.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.870
Are you?

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.870
What?

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.750
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.750
Well...

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.910
We saved those kids from unnatural desires.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.440
It's true, that sometimes the only way to
manage teenage sex is by acts of

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440
extreme violence.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.709
Which is good, because violence is awesome!

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:51.209
Eeoww... this whole place smells so yucky!

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:53.959
Well, that's because we're near the school.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:58.810
Look, they're starting their spirit rally.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:09.790
Stinkpickle, Stinkpickle, rah, rah, rah.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.790
It's horrible.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.740
Are you okay?

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.220
I don't know.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.680
Something's wrong.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.130
My body's going through some changes.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.660
I noticed!

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.149
I-I-I have these desires,
and I can't control them.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:25.149
Me too.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:29.370
Desires to kill everyone in
a violent testosterone-fueled rage.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:35.900
Why, my voice is changing...
and I can shoot lazer beams out of my eyes.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.939
Look!

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:41.100
Feel my wrath, whore!

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.920
Let's get back to base,
we need to regroup.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920
Zoey!

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920
Zoey?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920
Don't make me smite you.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920
Yes!

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920
Smite me.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:56.759
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force!

00:10:56.759 --> 00:11:02.100
Team, that is the spirit.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.040
It's so good to see young people
motivated in a positive way.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.069
Oh my, what happened to you guys?

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:09.749
It was horrible, Mr. Hitzman.

00:11:09.749 --> 00:11:11.589
The girls weren't wearing pants.

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:14.370
Please, the vapors are enough to kill a man.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.680
Do you hear me,
Zoey and Tallulah?

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.680
You've been cursed.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680
No!

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.620
Now gather round, I have a plan.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.310
During tomorrow night's game.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.860
You sneak in to the science wing of Wickenburg
High,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.730
rescue the stem cells
and set them free in the forest.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.269
Saving America in the process.

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.360
What's a plan?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.600
Pay no attention to that now, Dirk,
for it is time for the grand finale.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.139
Parvenu Hills Academy rules!

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:45.269
Woo!

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:46.399
Yeah!

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.540
Yeah!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.670
Woo!

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.800
Yeah!

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.660
Game on Kung Fu Lazer girls.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.660
You hosers.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.120
You think you can defeat our
alternative agenda quite so easily?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.470
Well, while you're out harvesting stem cells,
we shall be harvesting you...

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.470
Hey?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.470
Hey?

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.470
Hey?

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.639
Kung Fu Rainbow Lazer Force!
