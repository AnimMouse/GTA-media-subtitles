For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.830
Coming next summer in 3-D from Fred's
Things just got a lot more...

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:27.230
complex in toy town.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:41.720
Neurotic Toys.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:01:03.480
You alright, lads?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.170
Oh, just fantastic, Martin.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.170
Wow!

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
Really?

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.260
Of course not you silly twat.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.090
I'm a fucking robot in a factory making fucking
sarcasm.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.720
Life would be total shit if I was even alive.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.380
Still, at least you fit in... with the lads
I mean.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.680
Oh too right, too right.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.400
Supping ale, looking at tits, right?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.421
Greasing myself, moaning my whole life, lying,
like a proper fucking geezer I am.

00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.330
And not being some rich man's meat warmer.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.330
Wait!

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.330
What do you mean?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.210
Just taking the piss Martin, don't mean nothin'
by it.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.140
Who is that piece of crumpet?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.090
Oh, can't remember her name but I had her
up the Gary.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.659
Good for you mate, anyway, excuse us Martin.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.180
Must get back to work or middle management
will grass us up again.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.800
Have fun at the ballet.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800
What?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.780
I don't like ballet.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.030
Bloody hell, I'll never be one of the lads.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.850
I like ale and birds as much as the next robot,
but I just don't fit in anywhere.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.560
I'll always be a tedious middle class droid.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.440
At least the boss still likes me.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440
Martin!

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.230
Martin, come in here dear boy.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.920
But at the same time, I'm really just a servile
little wretch.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.650
Oh, clean it nice.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.349
Yes, yes, I've made a boo-boo cake back there.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.750
N-N-No, no, further down, further down, further
down.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.340
Oh, thank you Martin.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.060
My God, look at that, fantastic rear-end.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.270
Love to take that little filly for a ride.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.510
Bet she'd take me to heaven and back.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720
Do you hunt Martin?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.920
No sir, but I love self-improvement.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.770
In fact, I wanted to talk to you about some
inefficiencies I've found.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.970
I think we could make some...

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.970
Sorry...

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.140
Ah, I think you've missed a bit.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.580
Get in good and deep.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.110
Can't have a rash.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.599
Oh, that's better... that's better.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.970
Hold me Martin.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.940
Tell me you want me.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000
Tell me Nanny wants me.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.709
Tell me Nanny wants me more than Freddy.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.750
Nanny loves you, more than Freddy.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.780
That's good, that's very good.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.770
Who ate all the cock?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.770
Who ate all the cock?

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.900
You posh bastard, you posh bastard!

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.680
You ate all the cock!

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680
Wanker!

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.370
I'm not posh, I'm not a pikey, I'm not gay!

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.370
Oh my stars!

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.099
My bloody gay-dar is off the charts!

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.599
I'm penis-pegged.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.849
Oww!

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.099
Wanker!

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.599
I just hate being middle class.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.310
I'm the loneliest robot in Great Britain.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.739
I don't fit in anywhere.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.269
All I do is make sarcasm all day, and worry
all night.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.840
At least I can have a pint, play games and
nobody will tell me to go to my room.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:19.099
Go to your room!

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:32.990
You totally suck at this game.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.819
I'm gonna combo you.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:37.819
Didn't you hear me?

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.819
You horrible little shit.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.819
Go to your fucking room!

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.819
Go to your fucking room!

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:41.819
Oh, oh, oh, oh yes... yes!

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:42.819
Oh... yeah!

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:43.819
Oh you're a nasty little robot.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.819
Oh...

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:45.819
Oh yank it good and hard!

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.819
Fuck me!

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.819
Oh, Maureen, not again?

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:48.819
I'm not cheating on you Martin, I'm a pleasure
droid.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:49.819
It's my nature to have sexual intercourse
with all these men.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.990
It's not even like I enjoy it that much.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.873
I know I'm emotionally inarticulate, what
with me being a... being a...

00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:57.873
A robot?

00:04:57.873 --> 00:05:00.779
A British man, a British robot.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.740
I want to marry you, make little robots together.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.610
Maybe you could give up being a pleasure droid?

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.530
You must be joking?

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.449
I'd never marry you.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.780
You're broken, everyone knows it.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.990
We all laugh at you behind your back.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.990
Really?

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.900
No, of course not.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.159
But I do like sleeping with other men too
much to give it up.

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.210
They give me something you never can.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:31.150
Now, if you don't mind I am in the middle
of something here.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.550
I am in the middle of something here.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.550
Look Rosie, we're made of different things.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.550
That tickles.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.550
Mother!

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.550
Are we in the middle of something here?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.550
We were just playing!

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:58.870
Maybe you'd be a better son if you weren't
playing with filthy girls.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.539
Come here you!

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.539
What are you doing, mother?

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:06.539
Don't!

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.539
No!

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:08.539
No!

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.539
No!

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.539
What are you doing Martin?

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.539
Don't!

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.539
What the hell have you done?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.539
You bourgeois-tincan-nut-job.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.539
I loved her!

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.539
I'll recycle you for this you little shit,
come here!

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.539
Twat!

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.539
Twat!

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:18.539
Twat!

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.539
Twat!

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:20.539
Twat!

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.539
Twat!

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.539
Twat!

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:23.539
Bloody hell.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.539
What have I done?

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.210
I need to get her reprogrammed.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.469
To love me this time.

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.399
I know, I'll go see Phil, best friend!

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.899
Good loyal lad.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:36.840
Serves a fine pint and doesn't make me feel
like an awkward middle class twat.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.099
He'll know what to do about getting Maureen
reprogrammed.

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.879
And those perverts off my case.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.009
Oh my god!

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.379
Phil!

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:50.139
What happened?

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.120
I'm sorry, Phil's been decommissioned.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.539
I know you gents were pals but onwards and
upwards, yeah?

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.169
The new model Phil comes with a touch screen,
brilliant!

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.229
You cretin!

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:06.930
Fuck off, he's dead you mong!

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:46.819
Built in obsolescence, we all love it.

00:07:46.819 --> 00:08:15.310
He was my best friend!

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:49.490
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:55.190
Argh!

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.890
No!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.590
Argh!

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.290
Finally!

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.770
The last piece!

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:33.200
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.430
Will you marry me Maureen?

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.960
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight!

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:54.120
A toast to celebrate!

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.610
Phil!
