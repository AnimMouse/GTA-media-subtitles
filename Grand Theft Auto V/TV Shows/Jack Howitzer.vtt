GTA V - Jack Howitzer
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/jackaud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.490
From the mid-nineteen eighties&nbsp;
to the early nineteen nineties,&nbsp;

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.310
it was the greatest time&nbsp;
in the history of America.&nbsp;

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.330
In Evacuator I finally won the Vietnam War.
With the help of my sidekick Ho Chi Bett,&nbsp;

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.060
and my Indian spirit guide Wandering Hands.&nbsp;

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.390
In Exploder: Evacuator part two,
I marry America and save my family&nbsp;

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.720
by killing more foreigners.
In Special Needs Cop,&nbsp;

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.400
I became a school teacher to bust a drug ring
moving coke through a school for special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.530
needs children.
I was the biggest.&nbsp;

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
I was the best,
and then everything went to shit.&nbsp;

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.870
I was convicted of a crime&nbsp;
I probably didn't commit.&nbsp;

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.840
So I just spent a few years in the joint.
Prison changes a man,&nbsp;

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.500
but I knew that Vinewood and my fans
would be here waiting for me.&nbsp;

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.370
Hey Carl, take care a ya dick.
Freedom...&nbsp;

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.260
Here I come.
Where is everybody?&nbsp;

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:24.670
Jack's back!
Unfortunately America had moved on.&nbsp;

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.410
And that's why I'm living here.
It's like nobody remembered the war.&nbsp;

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.250
Now it's all about fighting&nbsp;
terrorism on computers,&nbsp;

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.700
using drones and women.
In the old days we fought evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.010
using survivor knife sets
and steroids.&nbsp;

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.790
It was a lot better back then.
If there's one think I've learnt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.320
being an action hero movie star
is that Vinewood never moves on.&nbsp;

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.440
I'm back bitches...
and there's nothing you can do about it.&nbsp;

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.980
The eighties are never over, you&nbsp;
don't just turn off the eighties.&nbsp;

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:28.740
I'm Rufus Bellows.
I just signed Jack as a client.&nbsp;

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.280
This is our first big meeting,
first one, number one.&nbsp;

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.250
I gotta be honest,
I'm a little bit nervous.&nbsp;

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.040
Every time I gotta meet a star
the nerves get going 'cause,&nbsp;

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.340
mostly up until now I've only&nbsp;
worked with talking animals&nbsp;

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.750
and midgets, so you know.
It's time to get pro baby!&nbsp;

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.310
Who is it?
It's ah Rufus, your agent.&nbsp;

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.188
Well come in!
What do ya want?&nbsp;

00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:02.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey Jack.
Jack, whoa, lower the piece bro.&nbsp;

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.320
It's me Rufus.
You're gonna go big places with me remember?&nbsp;

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.040
I-I'm your new agent Jack.
You know the last one didn't work out so good.&nbsp;

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
I know a guy that can clean that up for you.
Ah, total DNA removal.&nbsp;

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:29.940
You know, I should give you a card.
What can you do for me?&nbsp;

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.820
And what can you do for me?
I can give you some tough love for starts.&nbsp;

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.350
Are those jars of urine in there?
Hey, stay out of there.&nbsp;

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.180
I will mow you down.
What's with crystal see-through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.360
slippers in the chair, here?
Is she... she dead?&nbsp;

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.810
She's meditating.
Jack...&nbsp;

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.310
Jack...
I am a huge fan, Jack.&nbsp;

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.380
I am so excited that you're out of prison
and you're ready to make your comeback.&nbsp;

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.310
You're gonna...
you're gonna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.170
claw your ass up that Vinewood sign, boy.
You're gonna take a dump on everybody down below.&nbsp;

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.770
But if you're gonna do those things,
you need to just explain to me what's...&nbsp;

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.460
what's going on with the puppet, here.
Hey, this is not a puppet.&nbsp;

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.980
That's Ho Chi Sock!
So... So it's like a therapy thing,&nbsp;

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.190
like a coping mechanism?
I don't cope!&nbsp;

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.330
I kill!
Yeah, death is his closure.&nbsp;

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.130
Death is his closure.
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, alright?&nbsp;

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.800
Hey, a little bit of role&nbsp;
playing never hurt anybody, huh?&nbsp;

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.650
I'm worried about Jack,
I'm worried about him, alright.&nbsp;

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.470
I knew things were bad...
I didn't know they were this bad.&nbsp;

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.300
Jack I'm the guy that's gonna&nbsp;
turn your career around.&nbsp;

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.350
His career is just fine, Rufus.
You got a problem with that?&nbsp;

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.260
He's still on top.
He's still number one Rufus!&nbsp;

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.570
The kid's still number one.
Ayo!&nbsp;

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.290
He's hoarding urine in there.
You saw it.&nbsp;

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.230
He's talking to a sock puppet.
He's got these...&nbsp;

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:24.060
patriotic delusions of grandeur, he's...
This is gonna be a fucking gold mine.&nbsp;

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.010
You smell that?
You smell it?&nbsp;

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.280
You smell it?
Homerun baby, over the fence!&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.270
Hey, life's been tough since I left prison
and befriended a sock.&nbsp;

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.640
But Ho Chi really understands me.
And this agent seemed like the kind of guy&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.780
who could get my career back on track.
Making action movies about Asians&nbsp;

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.344
and East Europeans.
Oh, I couldn't wait.&nbsp;

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:50.160
Neither could I!
Jack I wanna talk to you about my fee.&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.840
It's a little high but you get what you pay for.
Forty percent, no negotiations.&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.830
Oh no, I want sixty percent.
No less!&nbsp;

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.790
Alright?
Hey, you drive a hard bargain.&nbsp;

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.310
Okay, we did it.
Great to have you on board.&nbsp;

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.200
Way to go, alright.
Don't touch Jack!&nbsp;

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.800
Oh, alright Ho Chi. Okay.
Easy Ho Chi.&nbsp;

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.150
We called in a crew of guys&nbsp;
that do crime scene clean-up&nbsp;

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.130
to get all the hoarder stuff out.
Jack was not happy to let things go.&nbsp;

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.280
Nobody takes my piss!
Nobody takes our pee pee!&nbsp;

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.700
But we finally got the place cleaned up...&nbsp;

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.470
You know, almost.
Hello.&nbsp;

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.640
After all this women's work it&nbsp;
was time to get down to business.&nbsp;

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.850
Rufus, I'd like to pitch my new movie to you.
Okay.&nbsp;

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.900
I infiltrate a Chinese business
and I bomb all the factories&nbsp;

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.400
where the kids make the MP3 players...
And I bring all the jobs back to America.&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.080
And then I get these Chinese bankers,
you know, that keep America's debt hostage&nbsp;

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.320
and I mow them down and I&nbsp;
get myself some napalm...&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.500
and then I say to the fellas "Hey fellas...".
Jackie, Jackie,&nbsp;

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.540
listen, listen.
I love the whole stick it to the Chinese angle.&nbsp;

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.650
Super!
But people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.150
you know they're a bit more sensitive now.
Ah, well...&nbsp;

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.350
The eighties are over, you know.
The eighties aren't over.&nbsp;

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.260
I'll say when the eighties are over.
The eighties are never over!&nbsp;

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.530
You don't just turn off the eighties.
Okay, Jackie. Okay. Okay.&nbsp;

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.810
You know, I walk down the street now.
People recognize me.&nbsp;

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.210
People scream out at me.
Baby killer!&nbsp;

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.320
I never meant to kill that baby!
He's innocent.&nbsp;

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.280
He thought it was a chicken.
I thought it was a chicken.&nbsp;

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.730
That's all in the past!
That's all in the past, now!&nbsp;

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.950
Sit down Jackie, sit down.
It's all in the past.&nbsp;

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.430
How could it be in the past?
In the eighties I could fly an attack helicopter.&nbsp;

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.230
I could bomb any peasant village I wanted.
And I could feel up any girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.260
that I saw on the street.
They were movies, they weren't real.&nbsp;

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.300
Now we gotta get you real!
I want you living a whole fake life online,&nbsp;

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.240
that's step number one.
We're getting you a Lifeinvader page.&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.810
We're getting you a Bleeter account
and I want you posting all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.020
stupid annoying opinions, okay?
So we got him online,&nbsp;

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.180
and then people started to make&nbsp;
negative comments about him.&nbsp;

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:18.280
And then we had a major setback.
Go to hell!&nbsp;

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.920
You know what, Jack?
If you go around killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.720
every asshole that talks shit on the internet,
you're gonna have a few million assholes to kill.&nbsp;

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.450
"Get some ammo,
get some extra body bags&nbsp;

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.200
and get an extra-large popcorn,
'cause it's gonna be a long night".&nbsp;

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.740
That's a quote.
That's a quote from when Jack was popular.&nbsp;

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.420
Yeah, yeah, it's a quote from yourself.
And you know what? I'm pitching your movie,&nbsp;

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.870
nobody's biting.
What if I had a sex tape?&nbsp;

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.040
Like this...
Ba-ba-boom!&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.590
And she's like boom!
And I'm like boom!&nbsp;

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.330
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I'm directing this picture&nbsp;

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.780
because it's gonna be a number one hit.
Chinese people,&nbsp;

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.530
who wants to get killed in a movie?
Get in the car, let's go, let's go, let's go...&nbsp;

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.570
What's the problem?
I was inside a lady.
