Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/fos1aud.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.120
The talent show America deserves.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.830
Fame or Shame.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.290
The winner gets one million dollars
and tours around the country before

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190
disappearing back to bitter obscurity.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.290
The finals continue with...

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.290
She Male Bop.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.810
You guys are going to the finals.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.279
Mimes on Fire.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.279
Whoo!

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.289
What a talent!

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.310
I've never seen someone set fire to their
crotch before!

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.310
Fantastic.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.369
The Most Racist Guy in America!

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.680
You all disgust me!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.860
America loves you.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340
You are in the finals!

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.000
Recorded live from the Vinewood Bowl!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.870
Who will win it all?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.420
Who will humiliate themselves in front of
the world?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.610
Find out tonight on Fame or Shame the finals.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.200
Now, please welcome your host, Lazlow.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
Yeah!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.930
Oh, oh, oh no he didn't!

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.930
Yes!

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.020
Thank you,
thank you.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.489
Oh God, thank you so much.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.589
It's great to be back, thank you.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.179
Fame or Shame...

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.579
Completely original television.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.380
Something you've never seen before.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
We've got desperados performing,
we've got has-beens judging them,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539
we've got anodyne metrosexual
holding everything together.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.259
We are down to the top acts.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.689
It's the finals!

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:23.789
Yeah!

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.880
And here are our Fame or Shame judges.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.039
Let's introduce, you love him,
I love him.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.130
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.619
Hugh Harrison!

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.619
Woo!

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.939
So, who are you calling a has-been?

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.189
Um...

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.709
Hugh, save the venom for the acts.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.159
They're not even out yet.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.159
Do you have a stylist?

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.539
What's she dressed you as?

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.499
What do they call this look?

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.499
Morgue chic?

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.569
Gay romp?

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.579
Is that what it is?

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.450
Two gays, one cup?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.450
Look at ya!

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.450
Oh my God.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.450
Come on, Hugh.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.070
Ladies and Gentlemen, Anita Mendoza.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.070
Woo.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.849
Give the guy a break.

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.659
Guy...
or gay?

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:16.170
This chap is so deep in the closet,
his friends call him mothballs.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.069
Ok, ok.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.769
Listen, why are you so fascinated with my
sexuality?

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.270
Are you even really British?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.380
Of course, I'm from Stafford-shire-burg-on-sea...

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.380
Mate.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.670
Uh huh, ok.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.670
Right.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.760
And finally ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Imran Shinowa.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.170
Yay!

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.340
Imran you're awfully quiet, like normally
by

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.840
now you're throwing refreshing sponsor beverages
at me.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.239
I've been meditating, Lazlow.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.349
Well... try not to do it on live TV, alright?

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.810
You're putting America to sleep.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.980
In my silence, a great God came to me and
asked me a question -

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.319
why does the metrosexual one dress like such
a turd?

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.749
Hey, hey,
I'm not the one who cares about his performance

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:06.749
tonight alright?

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.069
I've already won!

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.379
It's Fame or Shame.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.620
We're all friends here,
friends who slightly loathe each other

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.159
and say nasty things during contract renegotiations...
and yes, before you ask this is a Face brand

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.180
watch.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.200
Face!

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.840
Official chronograph of Fame or Shame.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.799
Fantastic Lazlow, and that reminds me.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.840
I'm just going to have a Junk energy drink.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.840
Junk!

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.080
The official energy drink of Fame or Shame.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080
Really?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.499
I wanted a nice can of refreshing Sprunk.

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:39.909
Sprunk!

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.510
The official soft drink of Fame or Shame.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.870
Can I mention that I bank with Fleeca,
so I've started paying for everything?

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.200
Fleeca.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.969
The official credit card of Fame or Shame.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.389
Excellent, I love it!

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.049
Subtle, organic sponsor tie-ins.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.279
Nice.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:02.019
Unlike your hair, you annoying poof.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.180
Oh Hugh, you are too much.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.060
It's a combination of the accent and the incredibly
witty lines.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.440
Oh yes, well the British.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.090
Overweight, rainy, rednecks,
who are always trying to sound smart.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.440
Alright let's get down to it, enough of this
nonsense.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.060
Tonight, in association with Lombank,
here are some of Hugh's greatest moments from

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.430
this season,
just to fill some time!

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.440
You are absolutely awful.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.280
Almost as bad as Lazlow.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.590
That was like having my balls sucked by an
elderly orang-utan...

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.120
and I'm not Lazlow,
so that wouldn't be a lot of fun for me, would

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
it?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960
I hope, I really do hope and pray that you
die a painful death

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.930
immediately after Lazlow.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.669
I'm losing the will to live here.

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.789
Really, truly, you're awful.

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.910
Awful, awful, awful, awful...

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.340
I can't say it enough,
I will say it again, awful.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.340
Awful!

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.340
Wait, what are you doing?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.340
Argh, my God.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.960
Getting a bit wild, stop!

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.530
Jesus Christ.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.250
We've got a great night of television for
ya...

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.370
Arghh.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.490
Goddammit!

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.849
You're fucking hur...

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:42.410
Hugh,
you British have such a sophisticated sense

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.349
of humor.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.523
Yes, the British, so funny...

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:46.523
So funny...

00:05:46.523 --> 00:05:47.523
I love you, buddy.

00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:48.523
I love you too!

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:49.523
Right here...

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.220
The weird thing is he really does love me,
yeah.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.509
Or at least he tries to every night in my
dressing room.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.129
Come on, please, alright.

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.000
I was drunk, I mean.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.919
I'd rather finger that fat Irish singer we
voted off last week.

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.780
Oh, the tabloids say you actually did.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.780
What?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.430
Had sex in exchange for advancing her to the
finals.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.430
Boo!

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.430
Please, please.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.440
Who listens to fat people?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.840
Or the tabloids?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.110
I mean they're all so desperate.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.060
Anyway let's get on with the show.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.510
Ladies and Gentleman, Fame or Shame.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.750
Our next contestant...

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.729
William Angio.

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:35.669
Whoa, so good to see you.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.639
I am so excited.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:49.449
It's like when you sing a dream,
I feel like you are singing straight to me!

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.470
Because I am.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.490
Alright, alright, come on.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.330
We've got a show to do.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.330
Alright, Hugh?

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.919
Alright, well we're glad you made it to the
next round.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.509
We really want you to take your performance
to the next level

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.970
and prove the doubters wrong,
who are saying that me and everyone connected

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.229
to this show
have ruined pop music.

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.039
Because we have not!

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.740
Anyway, be rude to Lazlow,
he really likes it!

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.620
You... you really suck, dude.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.620
Wait a second.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.620
Lovely, that's good.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.150
How could I suck?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.000
I host a talent show, alright?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.750
I'm on national television.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.439
And I get paid a lot, alright?

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:32.500
And I get chicks.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.500
Here smell...

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.500
No, God!

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500
Alright, oh sorry that was a sandwich.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500
Smell!

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500
No, I don't wanna smell your finger.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500
Ok.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500
She wasn't even that fat.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500
Alright, so I'm not gay.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.560
Alright, whatever, let's get to it.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560
Okay?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.100
I am so desperate to hear you sing...

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.550
I mean last time you were fantastic.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.539
So you're gonna do a Love Fist classic, right?

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:53.620
No, it's from one of Jezz's solo records,
which I'm going to improvise,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.449
with the help of this pre-recorded backing
track,

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.020
conveniently placed wind machine
and expensive mood lighting.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.080
It was number one in Germany for nineteen
weeks.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.539
It's called...

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:03.139
This is a Power Ballad.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:07.879
Alright, well yeah, about the wind machine,
me and the stinky finger girl kind of busted

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:09.410
it earlier, but...

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.620
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.849
Are you ready?

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:12.849
Yes I am.

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:16.129
Alright, it's Fame or Shame for William Angio!

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:18.650
So hear it.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.849
We've been through a lot.

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:29.580
We're both hurt - You've cried and I've cried.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.580
Tears.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.470
But no one's yet been shot.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.510
Our romance has dwindled and died.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:52.810
But it's the flame that will never die
and this is a power ballad

00:08:52.810 --> 00:09:11.050
sung about you and I.
I usually sing about carnage and rape

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:20.760
but now I show I really hurt.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:32.250
I sit alone with my guitar on a fire escape
in the rain with dry hair but a soaking shirt.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.250
There's helicopters with floodlights showing
the way

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.040
I'm dangerous and this is a power ballad -
it's totally not the least bit

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040
gay.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
Gay!

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.040
I need a string quartet to come in right here.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040
'Cause nothing says rock like cellos and violins.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:56.330
This song's for the ladies while men go get
beers.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:06.240
See I don't just trash hotel rooms and shoot
heroin.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:22.740
The video should have two sluts fighting over
me!

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.570
Sluts!

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:43.330
'Cause this is a power ballad -
it's stupid but I sing it with all of my might.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.330
So let's remember that our flame will never
die.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.330
'Cause this is a power ballad -
Sung about you and I.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.330
Fantastic!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.330
I'm moist!

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.330
Let's take a break before we hear from the
judges

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.330
and find out if that was Fame or Shame.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.530
What do you guys think?

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.790
You wanna come see my trailer later?

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.790
Come on!

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.790
Awkward.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.790
Come on.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.760
Are you still stuck on 4G?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.760
Whiz wireless is the only network offering
incredible nine-G technology.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.790
Yes, that's the ninth generation.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.980
Featuring the new Drone, it's significantly
better than the iFruit phone.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.380
How do we know that?

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.640
Because we blatantly ripped off their design
and improved a couple of irrelevant features.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.300
9G, discover your future.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.710
You can't be the best if you aren't doing
eight things at once on a tiny screen.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.860
The Drone from Whiz Wireless.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.950
Together we're making your life nine times
better.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.080
That's the promise of the ninth generation!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.190
Whoo, sweet beans and bacon, that's good.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.430
Welcome back, sorry,
I was just finishing a refreshing Logger.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.430
Logger!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.590
The official beer of Fame or Shame.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.850
That's a lie.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.090
He just followed some poor guy in to the loo,
so he could show him his logger.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.200
Imran.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.040
Hey, it's been like 5 minutes since you said
anything.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.760
You're paid to talk buddy.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.180
I'm here in association with Flow Water.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.860
Flow Water.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.860
Hey.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.610
Let's take a minute for the troops, and...
and for disabled people, and...

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.710
and for sick pets, and...
and for ugly people.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.380
They...
they suffer the most of all.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.870
And speaking of ugly people...
is William a pimple on America's ass,

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.560
or a charming gnome in its garden?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.840
Fame or Shame.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.420
Anita?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.160
I think...
shame...

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.480
which is a shame.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480
It just...

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.750
It just wasn't there for me.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.040
That's gotta be pretty heart breaking, buddy.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.770
But you're not out of the running yet.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.770
Imran?

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.870
I just love the exciting variety of toppings
available at Up-n-Atom Burger.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.560
Up-n-Atom Burger.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
What?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.950
Shame, no question.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.650
Yeah, shame.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.610
Two down there power ballad boy.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.510
Let's talk to the big chief and hear from
him,

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.790
Hugh?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.290
Well William,
you know, umm.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.080
You are so ugly, ugly!

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.910
Even Lazlow would turn out the light...
and you sing like Jezz Torrent's arsehole

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.740
after a curry.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.860
Oh come on mate.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.850
One guy calls you talentless,
ugly and a waste of space on national television

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.920
and you cry?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920
Wow!

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.190
What are you thinking right now?

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.920
What's going through your head
as those tears are coming down your face,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920
buddy?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920
I'm just...

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.760
I'm just proud of the journey I've been on...

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.260
It means so much to me.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.260
God...

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.700
And my sick brother and our dead dog.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.900
Did I mention my mother, Lazlow?

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.200
Did I mention nobody cares?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.380
Well, she abandoned me.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.720
Woopsie-doo...

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.500
People are abandoning the show in droves.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.970
Our ratings are in the toilet.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.020
Somebody do something controversial.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.120
Anita flash your titties!

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120
No!

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.170
Have a mental breakdown, or something...

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.170
Unacceptable.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.170
What is this?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.210
Hugh, shoot him...

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.390
shoot him in the nuts.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.390
I...

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.390
I can't lose this gig.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.480
I got a mortgage to pay.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.360
When I feel anxiety I visit Pill Pharm.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.110
After my dad got sent to jail they foreclosed
on our farm too.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.570
Hold on, wait a minute...

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.820
Listen, I still gotta vote for William...

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.250
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.980
Alright, we've got one more vote on Fame or
Shame.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.240
Hugh?

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.050
I am going to vote...

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.450
Fame.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.850
What?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.250
Fame!

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.650
Woo!

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.950
America needs power ballads sung by top talent
with exciting back stories like you.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:45.040
And I'd like to sign you to my record label,
and make you a star.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.620
But first please, will you do me a favor?

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.620
What?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.620
Anything!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.620
What?

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.490
Do the honors and get us out of here
and take him out.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.510
What?

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.720
Punch him in the face!

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
What?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.900
What are you...

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.900
Sorry!

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.150
This has been Fame or Shame, the finals.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.420
We'll have more finals next week
brought to you in association with

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.740
Maibatsu cars and the Drone,
just like the iFruit phone,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.360
but lets you look down on people
in a whole new way.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.660
We'll see you on the next finals of Fame or
Shame!

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.260
Jesus, sweet donkeys!

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.800
Don't miss the next episode of Fame or Shame,
the finals.
