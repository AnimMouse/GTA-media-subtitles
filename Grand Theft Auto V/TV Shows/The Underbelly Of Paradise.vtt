GTA V - The Underbelly Of Paradise
Extracted from update.rpf/x64/data/lang/american_rel.rpf/underau.gxt2
For Anim's Gaming Mouse

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.050
Welcome to Los Santos.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.360
The city of celluloid,
sin,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.000
and cellulite removal.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.939
From dead starlets in Vinewood,
to the gang bangers in Davis and Strawberry,

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.620
and terrorist cells in Chumash,
to the drunken tourists in Del Perro Pier.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.780
It's time to take a look inside this
cesspit of destroyed dreams,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.900
drug addled degenerates,
and deluded desperados

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.670
that make up this...
great city of lights.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.820
Hi,
I'm decorated FIB agent Steven Haines.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.420
The FIB,
the Police Department

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.500
and the Sheriff's Office
are fighting a war out here every day.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.879
In a city where dreams too often become wet...
with tears.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.720
The Los Santos Docks,
this is where it all begins.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.680
The second largest port in the world,
the great orifice of American capitalism.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.610
Stuff coming in,
garbage going out.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.950
And hidden in over two million containers
a day,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.330
God only knows what.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.710
The Cartels pay off some low level schlob,
and suddenly you've got...

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.180
Military grade weapons,
badly cut crystal meth,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.229
and grade A Yay-Yo from Mexico
flooding our streets.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.610
And once it hits the hood,
it's anarchy.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.600
A side of murder, hold the fries!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.430
Or maybe the Chinese are slipping some of
our

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.659
high security weapons systems in with the
recycling.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.050
And we're giving up our national security
for nothing?

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.710
Who knows?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.380
Who cares?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.090
As long as the financial party continues,
we'll just keep picking up the pieces.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.920
A word to the wise kids,
never use PCP,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.119
it makes you wanna punch cops,
and run around naked.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.640
And not necessarily always in that order.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.970
Most of the time this illicit cargo makes
it straight to the gangs.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.761
But sometimes an ordinary Joe lets go,
and loses his shit after a pipe or two of

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:19.660
pleasure dust.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.010
The Vagos.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.480
Blood thirsty 'Chicanos' with a predilection
for

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.880
pain,
papaya juice,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.840
and spicy plantains.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.010
They're one of the largest Mexican street
gangs in the city.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.760
With rumored connections to several major
mafias.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.760
While half the battle out here is fought with
guns,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.550
the other half is with informants.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.570
Sometimes you need to become the bad guys,
to bust the bad guys.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.829
Alright guys, let's go!

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.040
When Ballas and the Families aren't shooting
each other,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.190
they're selling the dope
that the junkies are shooting in to their

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.730
veins.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.300
The Families love sports almost as much as
they love banging.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.820
Flashy,
arrogant,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.130
competitive and aggressive.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.790
They are life long bitter enemies of the Ballas.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.260
Wearing the colors of the Feud or the Corkers.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.650
The Families call themselves gang green.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.120
Of course, like all families
they love a good squabble.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.840
Subdivided in to sets such as,
The Chamberlain Gangsters,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.760
or the Carson Avenue Set.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.630
It turns out the Families love shooting each
other,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.950
almost as much as they love shooting Ballas.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.190
Now the LSPD have had many run-ins with various
Family sets over the years.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.500
With the Ballas, the FIB take a more community
outreach approach.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.450
H-hey guys, stay out of trouble now.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.840
Suck my dick, Steve fucking Haines.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.030
Now the Ballas fly the colors of the Los Santos
Panic,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.940
Or the Boars,
purple.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.420
Because they are the bruise on the face of
this city.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.100
While some thugs obviously prefer four wheels,
other desperados prefer two.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.370
Leather,
exhaust,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.630
and drugs.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.760
No!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.220
This isn't an exotic S&amp;M party,
these are one of the nation's toughest

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.479
outlaw motorcycle gangs.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.280
The Lost.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.850
Rumors are they get a new tattoo for every
person they stab.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.810
And it's definitely okay for your motorcycle
momma

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.820
to show her breasts to your friends.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.000
The FIB has been tracking the Lost for years.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.750
We've jumped from coast to coast,
and have spent more time in the Midwest

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.600
than a tornado spotter.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.530
When they're not running meth,
they're smoking it,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.480
or so I hear a dangerous new drug on the streets
called

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.070
Toilet Cleaner.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.590
And believe me,
your toilet will be cleaned after you've smoked

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.570
some of it.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.320
Of course, Vinewood being Vinewood,
it's not all about leathery dudes trying to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.150
show off on their motorbikes,
or roided up gangbangers stuck in some nineties

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.570
time warp.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:02.000
This is the town that made mass murder,
into nostalgia.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.190
Of course, to become truly popular,
your murder has to be both unsolved and gruesome.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.010
In a town full of alien spotters,
adults dressed as zombies,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.930
and entertainers dressed as cartoon characters,
it takes something particularly awful,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.130
to really catch people's attention.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.460
The famous unsolved murder of a Vinewood starlet
is one such case.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.980
For years,
horny nerds have wondered,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.610
what happened to Leonora Johnson?

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.850
And if they would have plucked up the courage,
to speak to her,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.290
or kill her themselves?

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.500
It's inspired film makers,
writers,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.720
and copycat killers.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.660
Conspiracy theorists
have blamed various celebrities,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.980
the mayor,
the Soviets,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.320
short skirts,
women's liberation,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.750
and hidden aliens embedded amongst us for
the murder.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.000
But not all crime is premeditated.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.550
Maybe drinking's your thing.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.820
Look at this drunken buffoon,
proving that...

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.240
there doesn't always need to be criminal intent,
to cause serious criminal damage.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.000
Or maybe you're just an over privileged poppycock
living on daddy's pension and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.500
protesting about the unfairness of capitalism.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.280
Maybe stock market manipulation is your bag?
or loan sharking,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.230
double identity theft,
assassination,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.050
or even worse...
swinging!

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.450
On our next episode,
I, Steven Haines will show you the flashier

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.640
side of crime in Los Santos,
Illegal street racing,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.490
cocaine, and vice.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.490
Yes.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.170
Speed, snort and sex.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.470
The alliterative threesome that helped hook
America on

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.000
The Underbelly of Paradise.
